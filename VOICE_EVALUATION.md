## 3. Recommended Architecture

### Option A: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
```
STT: Deepgram (keep current)
TTS: ElevenLabs (upgrade)

Benefits:
- Best of both worlds
- Natural conversations
- Still fast enough

Trade-offs:
- Two vendor dependencies
- Higher TTS cost
```

### Option B: All Deepgram (Current)
```
STT: Deepgram ✅
TTS: Deepgram ⚠️

Benefits:
- Single vendor
- Lowest latency
- Cheapest option

Trade-offs:
- Robotic voice
- Less engaging
```

### Option C: All ElevenLabs
```
STT: ElevenLabs (new!)
TTS: ElevenLabs

Benefits:
- Single vendor
- Best voice quality
- New STT is promising

Trade-offs:
- STT still in beta
- More expensive
- Unproven STT
```

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Current Issue (Today)
1. Debug why transcripts aren't processing
2. Ensure Deepgram STT → Response → TTS flow works
3. Test with better Deepgram voices (try all Aura models)

### Phase 2: Evaluate ElevenLabs TTS (This Week)
1. Keep Deepgram STT
2. Add ElevenLabs TTS option
3. A/B test user preference
4. Measure latency impact

### Phase 3: Production Decision (Next Week)
Based on testing:
- If latency < 500ms total: Use ElevenLabs TTS
- If users prefer natural voice: Accept cost increase
- If cost prohibitive: Optimize Deepgram prompts

## 5. Cost Analysis (Per Hour of Conversation)

### Current (All Deepgram):
- STT: 60 min × $0.0125 = $0.75
- TTS: ~50K chars × $0.015/1K = $0.75
- **Total: ~$1.50/hour**

### Hybrid (Deepgram + ElevenLabs):
- STT: 60 min × $0.0125 = $0.75
- TTS: ~50K chars × $0.30/1K = $15.00
- **Total: ~$15.75/hour**

### Optimization Strategies:
1. Cache common responses
2. Shorter, more concise responses
3. Premium tier only for ElevenLabs
4. Batch processing for non-real-time

## 6. Quick Test Code

```python
# Test ElevenLabs WebSocket
import websockets
import json
import base64

async def test_elevenlabs():
    uri = "wss://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM/stream-input?model_id=eleven_monolingual_v1"
    
    async with websockets.connect(
        uri,
        extra_headers={
            "xi-api-key": "YOUR_ELEVENLABS_KEY"
        }
    ) as websocket:
        # Send text
        await websocket.send(json.dumps({
            "text": "Hey! I found some great organic milk options for you.",
            "voice_settings": {
                "stability": 0.5,
                "similarity_boost": 0.75
            }
        }))
        
        # Receive audio
        async for message in websocket:
            data = json.loads(message)
            if data.get("audio"):
                audio_bytes = base64.b64decode(data["audio"])
                # Play audio_bytes
```

## 7. Immediate Fix Needed

The current issue isn't the voice quality - it's that transcripts aren't being processed. Let's fix that first, then evaluate voice options.
