# Voice Implementation Status

## Current State (2025-06-30)

### üü¢ Deepgram Conversational AI - WORKING
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080/static/voice_conversational.html
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fully functional
- **Features**:
  - STT: Deepgram nova-2 model
  - TTS: Deepgram aura-helios-en voice (robotic but working)
  - LLM: Gemini 1.5 Flash from Vertex AI
  - Product search integration working
  - Transcript capture for ML training

### üü° Gemini Native Voice - PARTIALLY WORKING
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080/static/voice_gemini.html
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Text-only mode
- **Issues**:
  - Gemini 2.5 native voice not yet available on Vertex AI
  - Function calling format incompatible with current SDK
  - Audio input/output not supported yet
- **Working**:
  - Text input/output with Gemini 1.5 Flash
  - Conversation flow
  - UI and WebSocket connection

### üü¢ Deepgram Voice Agent API - READY TO TEST
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implementation complete
- **Features**:
  - Combines Deepgram STT/TTS with custom LLM (Gemini)
  - Better conversation flow management
  - Not yet tested

## Recommendations

1. **For immediate use**: Use Deepgram Conversational AI
   - Working end-to-end
   - Voice is robotic but functional
   - All features operational

2. **For better voice quality**: Consider ElevenLabs TTS
   - More natural voices
   - Higher cost but better quality
   - Easy to integrate

3. **For future**: Wait for Gemini 2.5 native voice
   - Will provide best quality when available
   - Integrated STT/TTS/LLM in one model
   - Lower latency

## Next Steps

1. Test Deepgram Voice Agent API for better conversation flow
2. Add ElevenLabs TTS option for voice quality comparison
3. Monitor Vertex AI for Gemini 2.5 voice availability
4. Implement voice activity detection for better UX
