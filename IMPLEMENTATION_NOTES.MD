markdown# LeafLoaf LangGraph Implementation Notes

## 📅 Implementation Date: December 2024

## 🎯 Today's Focused Scope

### What We're Building:
- **LangGraph Agentic RAG** with rich state management
- **LangSmith Tracing** for complete visibility
- **Product Search Agent** only (simplified from full blueprint)
- **Sub-300ms latency** target
- **Weaviate Cloud** integration
- **GCP-ready deployment**

### Agent Flow (Simplified):
User Query
↓
Alpha Calculator (Dynamic/Configurable)
↓
Supervisor (Orchestration)
↓
Product Search Agent (Weaviate)
↓
Response Compiler
↓
API Response with LangSmith Traces

### What We're NOT Building Today:
- ❌ Pricing Agent
- ❌ Inventory Agent
- ❌ Personalization Agent
- ❌ Gemma 2 LLM Integration
- ❌ ML Recommendations

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### 1. **No LLM Dependency (Yet)**
- Agents use pure Python logic
- Faster development and testing
- Add Gemma 2 later when needed

### 2. **Dynamic Alpha with Static Fallback**
```yaml
Primary: Dynamic alpha calculation based on query
Fallback: Configurable static strategy (hybrid/semantic/keyword)
Override: Force static mode for testing
3. Weaviate Schema

Using existing product schema
Will add searchText field later
Retail pricing logic planned for future

📝 Configuration Files
Created:

config/agent_priorities.yaml - Agent timeouts and search strategies
.env - API keys and cluster URLs
requirements.txt - Python dependencies

Key Settings:

Search timeout: 280ms
Default alpha: 0.7 (hybrid)
LangSmith tracing: Enabled

🚀 Next Steps After Today

Add Enhancement Agents: Pricing, Inventory, Personalization
Integrate Gemma 2: For intelligent routing and responses
Implement Retail Pricing: Pack size intelligence
Add SearchText: Concatenated field for better search
Production Optimizations: Caching, connection pooling

📊 Success Metrics

markdown## 🔄 Architecture Clarification (Updated)

### Original Understanding vs. Actual Requirement:
- **What we built**: Simple state-based agents (sequential flow)
- **What's needed**: React (Reasoning + Acting) agents with tool calling
- **Key difference**: React agents can loop, call tools, and make decisions

### React Agent Pattern:
User Query
↓
Supervisor (React Agent)
├─ Reason: "I need to search for products"
├─ Act: Call product_search tool
├─ Observe: Results
└─ Reason: "I have enough info" → Response
OR "I need more info" → Loop

### Updated State Structure:
- Added `messages` list for conversation history
- Added `tool_calls` tracking
- Added `reasoning` steps
- Added `should_continue` for React loops

### Files to Update:
1. ✅ `src/models/state.py` - Added React support
2. ⏳ `src/agents/` - Need to rebuild as React agents
3. ⏳ `src/tools/` - Need to create tool definitions
4. ⏳ `src/core/graph.py` - Need conditional edges for loops

### Next Steps:
1. Create tool definitions (product_search, get_details, etc.)
2. Rebuild agents with React pattern
3. Add conditional routing in graph
4. Test React loops with LangSmith tracing
## 🤖 Agent vs Tool Clarification

### Definitions:
- **Tool**: Simple function that does ONE thing (e.g., search Weaviate, get details)
- **Agent**: Autonomous entity that reasons, decides, and calls tools

### Updated Autonomous Flow:
Supervisor Agent

Analyzes query intent
Decides which agent should handle it
Routes to appropriate agent (doesn't call tools directly)


Product Search Agent (Autonomous)

Receives intent from Supervisor
Calls product_search tool
Analyzes results
Decides if refinement needed
Can call additional tools (filter, sort, etc.)
Puts final curated results in state


Response Compiler Agent

Reads final results
Formats for API response
Adds execution transparency




### Key Architecture Decision:
- **Agents are autonomous**: Each agent owns its tools and decisions
- **Clear separation**: Agents decide WHAT to do, Tools execute HOW
- **No tool sharing**: Supervisor doesn't call search tools, that's Product Search Agent's job

### React Pattern Per Agent:
while not done:
1. Reason: Analyze current state
2. Act: Call appropriate tool(s)
3. Observe: Check results
4. Decide: Continue or done

### Benefits:
- ✅ Each agent has clear responsibility
- ✅ Easier to add new agents
- ✅ Better testing isolation
- ✅ True React autonomous agents

markdown## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Solutions (Dec 2024)

### 1. **Weaviate Client Version**
- **Issue**: Weaviate v3 client deprecated, v4 required
- **Solution**: Updated to Weaviate v4 API
  ```python
  # OLD (v3)
  client = weaviate.Client(url=..., auth_client_secret=...)
  
  # NEW (v4)
  client = weaviate.connect_to_wcs(
      cluster_url=...,
      auth_credentials=AuthApiKey(...)
  )
2. Config File Location

Issue: config/agent_priorities.yaml not found
Solution: File must be in project root, not in src/

3. Import Structure

Proper imports for Weaviate v4:
pythonimport weaviate
from weaviate.auth import AuthApiKey
import weaviate.classes as wvc

markdown## 📊 Weaviate Schema Discovery

### Actual Product Properties:
Our Weaviate Product class has these properties (different from initial assumptions):

```yaml
Product:
  - name: Product name (main search field)
  - searchTerms: Optimized search terms
  - sku: Stock keeping unit
  - category: Product category
  - supplierCategory: Baldor's category
  - isOrganic: Boolean flag
  - packSize: Distributor pack size
  - retailPackSize: Customer-facing size
  - caseQuantity: Units per case
  - wholesalePrice: Distributor price
  - retailPrice: Customer price
  - priceType: Pricing model
  - usage: Product usage/description
  - supplier: Supplier name
  - lastUpdated: Timestamp
Key Learnings:

Search fields: name and searchTerms are primary search targets
Pricing already handled: retailPrice and retailPackSize exist
No Description field: Using name and usage instead
Organic flag: isOrganic boolean instead of parsing text

Search Configuration:

Hybrid search automatically uses text fields
Alpha=0.7 balances keyword and semantic search
No need to specify search fields explicitly

🔄 Next Optimizations:

Use searchTerms for better matching
Filter by isOrganic for organic queries
Use category for category browsing
Leverage retailPrice and retailPackSize for customer display

🚀 Current Working State:

✅ Weaviate v4 connected
✅ Correct schema mapped
✅ Search executing with actual properties
✅ React agents functioning
✅ Full execution transparency

# LeafLoaf LangGraph Implementation Notes - FINAL STATUS

## 🎯 Project Summary
Built a LangGraph-based multi-agent RAG system with React agents for intelligent product search using Weaviate vector database.

## ✅ What's Working
1. **LangGraph Architecture**
   - Multi-agent graph with proper state management
   - Supervisor → Product Search → Response Compiler flow
   - React agents with tool calling capability
   - Full execution transparency with timing

2. **Weaviate Integration**
   - Successfully connected to Weaviate Cloud
   - HuggingFace authentication working
   - Can query products with BM25 and Hybrid search
   - Verified 1000+ products in database

3. **API Layer**
   - FastAPI with OpenAPI documentation
   - Proper request/response models
   - LangSmith tracing integrated
   - Sub-100ms response times

4. **Configuration**
   - Environment variables properly loaded
   - YAML-based agent configuration
   - Configurable search strategies

## 🐛 Current Issues

### 1. **Product Search Not Returning Results**
- **Symptom**: API returns no products despite Weaviate having data
- **Root Cause**: Product Search agent not executing tool calls
- **Debug Finding**: Supervisor recognizes queries correctly (0.80 confidence)
- **Next Step**: Check why `pending_tool_calls` is empty in Product Search agent

### 2. **Duplicate Reasoning Steps**
- **Symptom**: Same reasoning message appears 4 times
- **Likely Cause**: State update issue in graph execution
- **Fix**: Check state mutations in agents

### 3. **Console Logging Not Visible**
- **Issue**: structlog messages not appearing
- **Fix**: Configure structlog properly in main.py

## 🔧 Quick Fixes for Next Session

### 1. Fix Product Search Tool Execution
```python
# In product_search.py, ensure tool calls are created
if iterations == 1:
    tool_call = {
        "id": f"call_search_{iterations}",
        "name": "product_search",
        "args": {"query": query, "limit": 15}
    }
    state["pending_tool_calls"].append(tool_call)
    Tomorrow's Priorities
1. Fix Search Results

Debug why tool executor isn't running
Verify state flow between agents
Test search tool directly

2. GCP Deployment

Create Dockerfile
Set up Cloud Run
Configure environment variables
Set up Cloud Build

3. Performance Optimization

Add connection pooling for Weaviate
Implement caching
Optimize agent execution

📊 Architecture Decisions

React Agents: Autonomous with reasoning loops
Tool Separation: Agents decide, tools execute
No LLM Yet: Pure logic for faster development
Weaviate Cloud: Using managed service
## 🔧 Final Debug Session Results

### Issue Identified: State Flow Problem
The core issue was state fields not being properly defined and initialized.

**Root Cause**: 
- Supervisor sets `routing_decision` = "product_search"
- But Product Search agent receives `routing_decision` = None
- Missing field definitions in SearchState TypedDict

**Fix Applied**:
1. Added missing fields to `SearchState`:
   - `routing_decision: Optional[str]`
   - `should_search: bool`
   - `search_params: Dict[str, Any]`
   - `span_ids: Dict[str, str]`

2. Initialize all state fields in `create_initial_state()`

3. Fixed routing check in Product Search agent

### Console Logging Now Working
- Added proper logging configuration in `run.py`
- Can see full execution flow in console
- Each agent logs its decisions and timing

### Current Status After Debug
- ✅ API responds correctly
- ✅ Supervisor classifies queries properly (0.8 confidence for "potatoes")
- ✅ Routing decision flows through state
- ✅ Product Search agent executes
- ⏳ Tool execution needs verification

### Remaining Issue
Product Search agent runs but may not be creating/executing tool calls properly. Need to verify:
1. Tool calls are being created in `_plan_tool_calls()`
2. Tool executor is running
3. Weaviate search is executing

### Key Learning
**State Management is Critical**: In LangGraph, every field used by agents MUST be:
1. Defined in the State TypedDict
2. Initialized in the initial state
3. Properly typed for TypeScript/type checking

### Next Session TODO
1. Verify tool execution flow
2. Ensure Weaviate search returns results  
3. Deploy to GCP
4. Add remaining agents

**End Status**: Architecture working, state flow fixed, ready for final tool execution debugging.
