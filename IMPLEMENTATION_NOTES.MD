markdown# LeafLoaf LangGraph Implementation Notes

## 📅 Implementation Date: December 2024

## 🎯 Today's Focused Scope

### What We're Building:
- **LangGraph Agentic RAG** with rich state management
- **LangSmith Tracing** for complete visibility
- **Product Search Agent** only (simplified from full blueprint)
- **Sub-300ms latency** target
- **Weaviate Cloud** integration
- **GCP-ready deployment**

### Agent Flow (Simplified):
User Query
↓
Alpha Calculator (Dynamic/Configurable)
↓
Supervisor (Orchestration)
↓
Product Search Agent (Weaviate)
↓
Response Compiler
↓
API Response with LangSmith Traces

### What We're NOT Building Today:
- ❌ Pricing Agent
- ❌ Inventory Agent
- ❌ Personalization Agent
- ❌ Gemma 2 LLM Integration
- ❌ ML Recommendations

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### 1. **No LLM Dependency (Yet)**
- Agents use pure Python logic
- Faster development and testing
- Add Gemma 2 later when needed

### 2. **Dynamic Alpha with Static Fallback**
```yaml
Primary: Dynamic alpha calculation based on query
Fallback: Configurable static strategy (hybrid/semantic/keyword)
Override: Force static mode for testing
3. Weaviate Schema

Using existing product schema
Will add searchText field later
Retail pricing logic planned for future

📝 Configuration Files
Created:

config/agent_priorities.yaml - Agent timeouts and search strategies
.env - API keys and cluster URLs
requirements.txt - Python dependencies

Key Settings:

Search timeout: 280ms
Default alpha: 0.7 (hybrid)
LangSmith tracing: Enabled

🚀 Next Steps After Today

Add Enhancement Agents: Pricing, Inventory, Personalization
Integrate Gemma 2: For intelligent routing and responses
Implement Retail Pricing: Pack size intelligence
Add SearchText: Concatenated field for better search
Production Optimizations: Caching, connection pooling

📊 Success Metrics

✅ Sub-300ms response time
✅ LangSmith trace visibility
✅ Clean agent architecture
✅ Configurable search strategies
✅ GCP deployment ready

This file - What we actually built today


Note: This implementation is Phase 1 of the larger LeafLoaf system. We're building the foundation with a focus on getting the core LangGraph pattern right before adding complexity.

This document:
1. ✅ Clarifies what we're building TODAY vs the full vision
2. ✅ Documents our technical decisions
3. ✅ Links back to the original blueprint
4. ✅ Sets clear next steps

markdown## 🔄 Architecture Clarification (Updated)

### Original Understanding vs. Actual Requirement:
- **What we built**: Simple state-based agents (sequential flow)
- **What's needed**: React (Reasoning + Acting) agents with tool calling
- **Key difference**: React agents can loop, call tools, and make decisions

### React Agent Pattern:
User Query
↓
Supervisor (React Agent)
├─ Reason: "I need to search for products"
├─ Act: Call product_search tool
├─ Observe: Results
└─ Reason: "I have enough info" → Response
OR "I need more info" → Loop

### Updated State Structure:
- Added `messages` list for conversation history
- Added `tool_calls` tracking
- Added `reasoning` steps
- Added `should_continue` for React loops

### Files to Update:
1. ✅ `src/models/state.py` - Added React support
2. ⏳ `src/agents/` - Need to rebuild as React agents
3. ⏳ `src/tools/` - Need to create tool definitions
4. ⏳ `src/core/graph.py` - Need conditional edges for loops

### Next Steps:
1. Create tool definitions (product_search, get_details, etc.)
2. Rebuild agents with React pattern
3. Add conditional routing in graph
4. Test React loops with LangSmith tracing
## 🤖 Agent vs Tool Clarification

### Definitions:
- **Tool**: Simple function that does ONE thing (e.g., search Weaviate, get details)
- **Agent**: Autonomous entity that reasons, decides, and calls tools

### Updated Autonomous Flow:
Supervisor Agent

Analyzes query intent
Decides which agent should handle it
Routes to appropriate agent (doesn't call tools directly)


Product Search Agent (Autonomous)

Receives intent from Supervisor
Calls product_search tool
Analyzes results
Decides if refinement needed
Can call additional tools (filter, sort, etc.)
Puts final curated results in state


Response Compiler Agent

Reads final results
Formats for API response
Adds execution transparency




### Key Architecture Decision:
- **Agents are autonomous**: Each agent owns its tools and decisions
- **Clear separation**: Agents decide WHAT to do, Tools execute HOW
- **No tool sharing**: Supervisor doesn't call search tools, that's Product Search Agent's job

### React Pattern Per Agent:
while not done:
1. Reason: Analyze current state
2. Act: Call appropriate tool(s)
3. Observe: Check results
4. Decide: Continue or done

### Benefits:
- ✅ Each agent has clear responsibility
- ✅ Easier to add new agents
- ✅ Better testing isolation
- ✅ True React autonomous agents

markdown## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Solutions (Dec 2024)

### 1. **Weaviate Client Version**
- **Issue**: Weaviate v3 client deprecated, v4 required
- **Solution**: Updated to Weaviate v4 API
  ```python
  # OLD (v3)
  client = weaviate.Client(url=..., auth_client_secret=...)
  
  # NEW (v4)
  client = weaviate.connect_to_wcs(
      cluster_url=...,
      auth_credentials=AuthApiKey(...)
  )
2. Config File Location

Issue: config/agent_priorities.yaml not found
Solution: File must be in project root, not in src/

3. Import Structure

Proper imports for Weaviate v4:
pythonimport weaviate
from weaviate.auth import AuthApiKey
import weaviate.classes as wvc
