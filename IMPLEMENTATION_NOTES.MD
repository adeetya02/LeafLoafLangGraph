markdown# LeafLoaf LangGraph Implementation Notes

## 📅 Implementation Date: December 2024

## 🎯 Today's Focused Scope

### What We're Building:
- **LangGraph Agentic RAG** with rich state management
- **LangSmith Tracing** for complete visibility
- **Product Search Agent** only (simplified from full blueprint)
- **Sub-300ms latency** target
- **Weaviate Cloud** integration
- **GCP-ready deployment**

### Agent Flow (Simplified):
User Query
↓
Alpha Calculator (Dynamic/Configurable)
↓
Supervisor (Orchestration)
↓
Product Search Agent (Weaviate)
↓
Response Compiler
↓
API Response with LangSmith Traces

### What We're NOT Building Today:
- ❌ Pricing Agent
- ❌ Inventory Agent
- ❌ Personalization Agent
- ❌ Gemma 2 LLM Integration
- ❌ ML Recommendations

## 🔧 Technical Decisions

### 1. **No LLM Dependency (Yet)**
- Agents use pure Python logic
- Faster development and testing
- Add Gemma 2 later when needed

### 2. **Dynamic Alpha with Static Fallback**
```yaml
Primary: Dynamic alpha calculation based on query
Fallback: Configurable static strategy (hybrid/semantic/keyword)
Override: Force static mode for testing
3. Weaviate Schema

Using existing product schema
Will add searchText field later
Retail pricing logic planned for future

📝 Configuration Files
Created:

config/agent_priorities.yaml - Agent timeouts and search strategies
.env - API keys and cluster URLs
requirements.txt - Python dependencies

Key Settings:

Search timeout: 280ms
Default alpha: 0.7 (hybrid)
LangSmith tracing: Enabled

🚀 Next Steps After Today

Add Enhancement Agents: Pricing, Inventory, Personalization
Integrate Gemma 2: For intelligent routing and responses
Implement Retail Pricing: Pack size intelligence
Add SearchText: Concatenated field for better search
Production Optimizations: Caching, connection pooling

📊 Success Metrics

✅ Sub-300ms response time
✅ LangSmith trace visibility
✅ Clean agent architecture
✅ Configurable search strategies
✅ GCP deployment ready

Note: This implementation is Phase 1 of the larger LeafLoaf system. We're building the foundation with a focus on getting the core LangGraph pattern right before adding complexity.

This document:
1. ✅ Clarifies what we're building TODAY vs the full vision
