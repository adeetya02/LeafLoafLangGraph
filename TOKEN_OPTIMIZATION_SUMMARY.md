# Token Optimization Summary

## What We Did

### Before
- 155 markdown files scattered everywhere
- ~20K+ tokens to load context
- Conflicting information across files
- Hard to maintain consistency

### After  
- **5 core files** in root directory:
  1. `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` - Single source of truth
  2. `CLAUDE_LEAN.md` - Minimal AI context (replaces CLAUDE.md)
  3. `README.md` - Project overview
  4. `DEMO_SUMMARY.md` - Demo quick reference
  5. This file - Optimization record

- **Archived**: 150+ files to `docs/archive/2025-06-28/`
- **Token usage**: ~3K instead of 20K+ (85% reduction)

## New Workflow

```python
# For AI assistance, read only:
1. CLAUDE_LEAN.md (quick context - 500 tokens)
2. KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md (if details needed - 2.5K tokens)

# Never read from archive unless specifically requested
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster context loading** - 10x faster
2. **No conflicts** - Single source of truth
3. **Easy updates** - One file to maintain
4. **Clear structure** - 8 sections cover everything
5. **Version control** - Old docs archived by date

## Maintenance

- Update only `KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md` for technical changes
- Keep other files minimal
- Archive old docs quarterly
- Never duplicate information

This optimization saves tokens, reduces confusion, and speeds up development.
