# STABLE DEMO CONFIGURATION

# Option 1: Use BM25 (keyword) search for demo
# This works immediately but doesn't show vector capabilities

# Option 2: Create new Weaviate instance
# 1. Go to https://console.weaviate.cloud
# 2. Create new cluster
# 3. Choose text2vec-openai as vectorizer
# 4. Import data with this configuration

# Option 3: Fix current instance
# Need to check Weaviate console for:
# - Vectorizer configuration
# - API key settings
# - Module configuration

# Current working search (BM25):
from weaviate.classes.query import Filter

def search_products_bm25(query, limit=10):
    collection = client.collections.get("Product")
    result = collection.query.bm25(
        query=query,
        limit=limit
    )
    return result.objects

# For proper vector demo, we need:
# 1. Working vectorizer (OpenAI/Cohere/HuggingFace)
# 2. Proper API keys configured
# 3. Data properly vectorized
