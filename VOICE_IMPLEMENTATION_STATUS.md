### üöß Latest Updates (2025-07-01)

1. **Voice Supervisor Integration Fixed**
   - Created `/api/v1/voice/process` endpoint that routes through supervisor
   - Fixed basic voice test page to use supervisor-aware endpoint
   - "Hello how are you" now properly recognized as greeting, not product search
   - General chat intents handled conversationally

2. **WebSocket Issues Identified & Fixed**
   - Fixed UnboundLocalError in voice_agent_deepgram.py
