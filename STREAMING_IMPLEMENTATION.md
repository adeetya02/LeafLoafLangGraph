# Streaming Voice Implementation

## Overview
Implemented streaming responses to reduce perceived latency in voice conversations.

## Latest Status (2025-07-01)
- **Request-Response Mode Working**: Basic voice functionality operational
- **True Streaming Not Yet Achieved**: User feedback - "doesn't feel like streaming"
- **WebSocket Issues**: Deepgram connections failing with HTTP 400
- **Supervisor Integration Complete**: Voice properly routes through intent detection

## Changes Made

### 1. Streaming TTS Implementation
- Added `_speak_streaming()` method that splits text into sentences
- Sends each sentence to TTS immediately rather than waiting for full response
- Natural chunking at sentence boundaries (. ! ?)

### 2. Product Response Streaming
- Created `_generate_product_response_streaming()` method
- Speaks initial response immediately: "I found X options for Y!"
- Continues generating and speaking detailed response while user hears initial

### 3. Performance Improvements
- Reduced perceived latency by starting TTS while Gemini is still processing
- Sentence-by-sentence streaming for natural speech flow
- Maintains conversation context and function calling

## Testing

### Test Script
```bash
python3 test_streaming_voice.py
```

### Expected Behavior
1. **Greeting**: Immediate response with streaming sentences
2. **Product Search**: 
   - Immediate: "I found X options..."
   - Followed by: Product details streamed
3. **Categories**: Streamed sentence by sentence

### Timing Improvements
- Before: Wait 446-1262ms for full Gemini response, then TTS
- After: Start speaking within ~100ms, continue streaming

## Architecture

```
User Speech → Deepgram STT → Gemini (with function calling) → Streaming TTS
                                   ↓
                            Function calls (search_products, show_categories)
                                   ↓
                            Stream responses in chunks
```

## Current Implementation Issues

### WebSocket Connection Problems
1. **Deepgram WebSocket Rejection**
   - Getting HTTP 400 errors when connecting to Deepgram
   - Likely API key or connection parameter issues
   - Multiple WebSocket endpoints created but not fully functional

2. **Not True Streaming**
   - Current implementation uses request-response pattern
   - Speech → Process → Response → Speech (sequential)
   - Missing bidirectional streaming capabilities
   - No real-time audio streaming to/from Deepgram

### Working Components
1. **Voice Supervisor Integration**
   - `/api/v1/voice/process` endpoint routes through supervisor
   - Intent detection working (greetings vs searches)
   - Conversational responses for general chat
   - Product searches properly routed

2. **Basic Voice Functions**
   - Web Speech API for STT
   - Browser TTS for responses
   - Search results displayed
   - Session management maintained

## Next Steps
1. **Fix Deepgram WebSocket Connection**
   - Verify API key validity
   - Debug connection parameters
   - Implement proper WebSocket handshake

2. **Implement True Bidirectional Streaming**
   - Continuous audio stream to Deepgram
   - Real-time transcription responses
   - Streaming TTS with interruption handling
   - Natural conversation flow

3. **Add Streaming Response Generation**
   - Stream Gemini responses token by token
   - Start TTS before full response ready
   - Implement proper audio queuing
   - Handle interruptions gracefully
