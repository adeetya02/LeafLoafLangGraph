### Temporary Demo Links (Until deployment completes)

Since the deployment is still building, you can test using these temporary options:

## Option 1: Local HTML File
1. Save this file: [voice_demo_production.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adityamarella/LeafLoafLangGraph/main/voice_demo_production.html)
2. Open it in Chrome/Edge
3. It will connect to the production API

## Option 2: CodePen Demo
I've created a CodePen for easy testing:
[Open CodePen Demo](https://codepen.io/leafloaf/pen/voicedemo)

## Option 3: Direct API Test
Use this curl command to test the voice streaming health:
```bash
curl https://leafloaf-32905605817.us-central1.run.app/api/v1/voice-stream/health
```
