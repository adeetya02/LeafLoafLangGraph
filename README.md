## 🚀 Overview

LeafLoaf is a production-grade **voice-native conversational AI** grocery shopping system featuring a sophisticated multi-agent architecture with Pure Graphiti Learning. The system learns from every user interaction to provide increasingly personalized shopping experiences without any hardcoded rules.

### Key Features

- **🎙️ Voice-Native AI**: Real-time voice processing with 1.3-1.5s response time
- **🤖 Multi-Agent System**: Voice-aware Supervisor → Product Search → Order → Response Compiler  
- **🧠 Pure Graphiti Learning**: Self-improving personalization with zero maintenance
- **📊 BigQuery Analytics**: Real-time streaming for ML and business intelligence
- **🔍 Hybrid Search**: Voice metadata influences dynamic search parameters
- **🎯 10 Personalization Features**: All learning-based, voice-integrated
- **🏗️ Production Ready**: 103/103 tests passing, voice-native architecture

## 🏃 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Google Cloud SDK
- Weaviate API credentials
- Vertex AI access

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/leafloaf.git
cd leafloaf

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.yaml.example .env.yaml
# Edit .env.yaml with your credentials

# Run tests
python3 run_all_personalization_tests.py
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start the development server
python3 run.py

# Access the API
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test search
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "organic milk", "user_id": "test_user"}'
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

```mermaid
graph TD
    User[User Query] --> Supervisor[Supervisor Agent]
    Supervisor --> Search[Product Search Agent]
    Supervisor --> Order[Order Agent]
    Search --> Compiler[Response Compiler]
    Order --> Compiler
    Compiler --> Response[Personalized Response]
    
    Graphiti[Graphiti Memory] --> Search
    Graphiti --> Order
    BigQuery[BigQuery Analytics] --> ML[ML Pipeline]
    ML --> Personalization[Personalization Engine]
```

### Data Flow

1. **Real-time Learning**: Every interaction updates Graphiti memory
2. **Async Analytics**: Fire-and-forget BigQuery streaming
3. **Personalization**: GraphitiPersonalizationEngine applies learned patterns
4. **Zero Latency**: All operations non-blocking

## 🎯 Personalization Features

All features use Pure Graphiti Learning - no hardcoded rules:
