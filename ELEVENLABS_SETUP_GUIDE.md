LeafLoaf Voice Shopping - Demo Instructions

1. Call: [Your ElevenLabs Phone Number]

2. Try saying:
   - "I need organic milk and bread"
   - "Show me your cheapest rice"
   - "Add 2 kg of tomatoes to my cart"
   - "What vegetables do you have?"
   - "What's in my cart?"
   - "I'm done, please confirm my order"

3. The assistant will:
   - Search for products
   - Tell you what's available with prices
   - Add items to your cart
   - Confirm your order

Tips:
- Say "the first one" or "number 2" to select from search results
- Ask "what's my total?" to check cart value
- Say "remove milk from cart" to remove items
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If webhooks aren't working:
1. Check the webhook URLs are exactly as shown above
2. Verify the API is still running: https://leafloaf-langraph-32905605817.us-central1.run.app/health
3. Check ElevenLabs logs for error messages

### If voice recognition is poor:
1. Ask customers to speak clearly
2. Reduce background noise
3. Try different voice models in settings

### Common Issues:
- **"Session not found"**: The conversation restarted. Start fresh.
- **"No products found"**: Try simpler search terms
- **Timeout errors**: The API might be cold starting. Try again.
