   "Show me organic vegetables"
   "What's the cheapest rice you have?"

2. Adding to Cart:
   "Add the first one to my cart"
   "Put 2 kg of tomatoes in my cart"
   "Add number 3"

3. Managing Cart:
   "What's in my cart?"
   "Remove the milk"
   "What's my total?"

4. Personalized Shopping:
   "I prefer organic products"
   "Show me gluten-free options"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If customers have issues:

3. **Voice not recognized**: Speak clearly, reduce background noise
4. **Session lost**: Just start over with a greeting

## 📈 Metrics to Track

After demos, ask customers:
- How easy was it to use? (1-10)
- Would they use this for real shopping?
- What features would they want added?
- Any frustrations or confusion?

5. Iterate based on learnings
