### 2. Fix Critical Memory Issues
- Uncomment session memory integration in `graphiti_memory_spanner.py:200`
- Increase memory timeouts from 50ms to 500ms
- Add retry logic for Spanner queries
- Implement proper health checks

### 3. Implement Voice-Native Features
- Word-level streaming for <200ms first audio
- Voice urgency detection from prosody
- Streaming routing decisions
- Interrupt handling

### 4. Add Multi-Modal Support (Phase 2)
