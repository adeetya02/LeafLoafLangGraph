# Branch: voice-clean-final - Current Status

## Branch Information
- **Branch Name**: voice-clean-final
- **Base Branch**: main
- **Created**: For implementing Deepgram streaming and voice-native architecture

## Current Work Status

### âœ… Completed
1. **Documentation Structure**
   - Created comprehensive codebase documentation (CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md)
   - Created visual flow diagrams (CODEBASE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md)
   - Created quick reference guide (CODEBASE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
   - Organized all MD files (DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md)

2. **Test Structure**
   - Set up organized test directory structure
   - Created test runner (run_tests.py)
   - Separated implementation work from production code

3. **Voice Integration Analysis**
   - Analyzed Deepgram streaming issue
   - Fixed keepalive mechanism (was sending JSON instead of audio)
   - Enhanced logging for debugging

### ðŸ”§ In Progress
1. **Deepgram Streaming Fix**
   - Issue: WebSocket connects but disconnects after 6-7 seconds
   - Root cause: Audio format mismatch or data not reaching Deepgram
   - Fix: Converting audio to linear16 PCM format
   - Test file: `/tests/implementation/deepgram/test_deepgram_fixed.html`

### ðŸ“‹ TODO (from NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT_DEEPGRAM_STREAMING.md)
1. Fix Deepgram streaming audio processing
2. Complete voice integration flow (Voice â†’ Deepgram â†’ Supervisor â†’ Products)
3. Implement multi-modal supervisor (voice + image)
4. Enhance voice metadata collection
5. Implement holistic voice analytics

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Documentation
- CODEBASE_STRUCTURE.md - Complete codebase map
- CODEBASE_FLOW_DIAGRAM.md - Visual architecture diagrams
- CODEBASE_QUICK_REFERENCE.md - Quick navigation guide
- DOCUMENTATION_STRUCTURE.md - All MD files organized
- HOLISTIC_VOICE_ANALYTICS.md - Voice analytics design
- NEXT_SESSION_PROMPT_DEEPGRAM_STREAMING.md - Next session plan

### Code Changes
- `src/voice/deepgram/nova3_client.py` - Fixed keepalive to send audio instead of JSON
- `src/api/voice_deepgram_endpoint.py` - Added detailed logging
- `src/api/main.py` - Added test file mounting for development

### Test Files
- `tests/implementation/deepgram/test_deepgram_streaming.html` - Linear16 audio test
- `tests/implementation/deepgram/test_deepgram_fixed.html` - Enhanced debugging
- `tests/implementation/deepgram/test_direct_audio.py` - Direct audio flow test

## Current Issues

### Deepgram Streaming
- WebSocket connects successfully
- Deepgram connection established
- Audio chunks not being processed properly
- Error: "Deepgram did not provide a response message within the timeout window"

### Next Steps
1. Debug why audio isn't reaching Deepgram properly
2. Test with real microphone input
3. Verify supervisor integration once streaming works
4. Implement voice metadata flow through system

## Commands to Continue

```bash
# Start server
python3 run.py

# Test Deepgram streaming
http://localhost:8080/tests/deepgram/test_deepgram_fixed.html

# Run tests
python3 run_tests.py --component deepgram
```

## Branch Strategy
- Keep all experimental work in `tests/implementation/`
- Once working, move to appropriate `src/` location
- Maintain <2s response time target
- Use fire-and-forget for analytics
