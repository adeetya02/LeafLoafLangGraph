# BDD Scenarios: Dietary & Cultural Intelligence (Feature #6)

## Feature Overview
As a grocery shopper with dietary restrictions or cultural food preferences, I want LeafLoaf to automatically understand my needs and intelligently filter/suggest products, so that I can shop efficiently without constantly explaining my requirements.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Story 1: Auto-Detect Vegan Preferences
**As a** vegan shopper  
**I want** LeafLoaf to detect my dietary preference from my purchase history  
**So that** I don't see non-vegan products in my search results  

**Scenario**: Vegan pattern detection and filtering
```gherkin
Given I have purchased only plant-based products for the last 10 orders
When I search for "milk"
Then I should see only plant-based milk alternatives
And the response should explain "Showing plant-based options based on your preferences"
And I should have the option to see all results if needed
```

### Story 2: Cultural Cuisine Understanding
**As a** shopper who cooks South Indian food  
**I want** LeafLoaf to understand when I'm shopping for specific dishes  
**So that** I get all the right ingredients suggested together  

**Scenario**: Cultural ingredient grouping
```gherkin
Given I frequently buy South Indian cooking ingredients
When I search for "sambar ingredients"
Then I should see toor dal, tamarind, sambar powder, curry leaves
And the system should suggest "You might also need: mustard seeds, hing"
And quantities should match typical recipe requirements
```

### Story 3: Allergen Avoidance Detection
**As a** parent of a child with nut allergies  
**I want** LeafLoaf to learn and remember allergen restrictions  
**So that** dangerous products are automatically filtered out  

**Scenario**: Allergen pattern learning
```gherkin
Given I have never purchased products containing nuts
And I have viewed but not added nut products to cart 5+ times
When I search for "snacks for kids"
Then all results should be nut-free
And the response should indicate "Filtered to show nut-free options"
And there should be a clear allergen warning system
```

### Story 4: Smart Dietary Substitutions
**As a** shopper transitioning to gluten-free  
**I want** LeafLoaf to suggest appropriate substitutions  
**So that** I can maintain my favorite meals with suitable alternatives  

**Scenario**: Intelligent substitution suggestions
```gherkin
Given I recently started buying gluten-free alternatives
When I search for "pasta"
Then I should see gluten-free pasta options prominently
And the system should note "Showing gluten-free alternatives"
And I should see my previously purchased gluten-free brands first
```

### Story 5: Multiple Dietary Restrictions
**As a** shopper who is both diabetic and lactose intolerant  
**I want** LeafLoaf to handle multiple dietary needs simultaneously  
**So that** all my health requirements are respected  

**Scenario**: Combined dietary filtering
```gherkin
Given I have patterns showing low-sugar and dairy-free preferences
When I search for "breakfast cereal"
Then results should be both low-sugar AND dairy-free
And the filtering logic should be transparent
And I should be able to toggle each restriction independently
```

## Technical Acceptance Criteria

### Performance
- Feature must add <100ms to response time
- Dietary detection must work with 10+ orders of history
- Must handle users with 0-5 different dietary restrictions

### Accuracy
- 90%+ accuracy in dietary pattern detection after 10 orders
- Zero false positives for allergen filtering
- Cultural patterns recognized with 5+ relevant purchases

### User Control
- Feature flag: `dietary_cultural_intelligence`
- Manual override for all auto-detected patterns
- Clear explanation of why products were filtered
- Easy way to see unfiltered results

### Privacy
- All dietary data stored at user level only
- No sharing across users
- Explicit opt-in for allergen detection
- Clear data deletion options

## Success Metrics
1. **User Satisfaction**: 80%+ keep feature enabled after trying
2. **Filter Accuracy**: <1% complaint rate about incorrect filtering
3. **Performance**: 95th percentile latency <100ms
4. **Adoption**: 60%+ of users with 10+ orders have patterns detected
5. **Safety**: Zero reported allergen exposure incidents

## Implementation Notes
- Start with common dietary patterns (vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free)
- Use confidence scoring (require consistency over time)
- Implement gradual learning (don't filter aggressively early)
- Always provide transparency and control
- Consider seasonal/temporary dietary changes
