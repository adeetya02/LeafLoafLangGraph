# Graphiti Use Cases for LeafLoaf (Without ML)

## ðŸŽ¯ Powerful Use Cases to Implement

### 1. "Order my usual monthly supplies"
```python
# User says: "Order my usual monthly supplies"

# Graphiti Query:
context = await graphiti.search(
    "User123 monthly regular purchases",
    time_range=timedelta(days=90)
)

# Returns:
{
    "monthly_items": [
        {"product": "Basmati Rice", "typical_quantity": 2, "frequency": "every 28 days"},
        {"product": "Toor Dal", "typical_quantity": 3, "frequency": "every 30 days"},
        {"product": "Atta Flour", "typical_quantity": 1, "frequency": "every 25 days"}
    ],
    "total_orders": 12,
    "pattern": "consistent_monthly"
}
```

### 2. "What did I get for the last party?"
```python
# User says: "What did I order for my last party?"

# Graphiti traverses:
User â†’ [ORDERED_FOR_EVENT] â†’ "Diwali Party 2024"
     â†’ [EVENT_INCLUDED] â†’ Products[]
     â†’ [SERVED] â†’ "30 people"

# Returns complete party order with quantities
```

### 3. "I need rice like last time"
```python
# User says: "I need rice like last time"

# Graphiti finds:
Last rice order â†’ [WAS_BRAND] â†’ "Laxmi Basmati"
               â†’ [QUANTITY] â†’ "2 x 20 LB"
               â†’ [ORDERED_WITH] â†’ "Ghee", "Saffron"
               â†’ [DATE] â†’ "2 weeks ago"
```

### 4. Shopping Pattern Recognition
```python
# Weekend bulk shopping pattern
Friday/Saturday â†’ [ORDERS_INCREASE] â†’ +40%
                â†’ [COMMON_ITEMS] â†’ "Paneer", "Vegetables"
                â†’ [PURPOSE] â†’ "Weekend cooking"

# Monthly restaurant supplies
Month_Start â†’ [BULK_ORDER] â†’ "Rice", "Dal", "Flour"
           â†’ [QUANTITY] â†’ "Restaurant pack sizes"
```

### 5. Product Relationships
```python
# Graphiti discovers relationships
"Paneer" â†’ [BOUGHT_WITH] â†’ "Spinach" (75% of time)
        â†’ [FOLLOWED_BY] â†’ "Cream" (within 2 days)
        â†’ [RECIPE_CONTEXT] â†’ "Palak Paneer"
```

### 6. Consumption Patterns (No ML Needed)
```python
# Simple time-based patterns
"Milk" â†’ [PURCHASE_FREQUENCY] â†’ "Every 3 days"
      â†’ [LAST_PURCHASED] â†’ "3 days ago"
      â†’ [STATUS] â†’ "Due for reorder"

# Seasonal patterns
"October" â†’ [INCREASED_ORDERS] â†’ "Ghee", "Sugar", "Nuts"
         â†’ [EVENT_CORRELATION] â†’ "Diwali prep"
```

### 7. Event-Based Shopping Memory
```python
# Graphiti remembers event shopping
"Super Bowl 2024" â†’ [ORDERED] â†’ "Chips", "Salsa", "Soda"
                 â†’ [QUANTITY] â†’ "Party size"
                 â†’ [TOTAL_SPENT] â†’ "$125"

# User says: "I'm having another Super Bowl party"
# System suggests the same items with similar quantities
```

### 8. Brand Loyalty Tracking
```python
"Rice" â†’ [BRAND_HISTORY] â†’ {
    "Laxmi": 15 purchases,
    "Vistar": 2 purchases,
    "Other": 1 purchase
}
â†’ [PREFERENCE] â†’ "Strong Laxmi preference"
```

### 9. Quantity Intelligence
```python
# Graphiti tracks quantity patterns
"Restaurant User" â†’ [TYPICAL_ORDER] â†’ {
    "Rice": "20-40 LB",
    "Dal": "10-15 LB",
    "Oil": "1 gallon"
}

# vs Retail User
"Home User" â†’ [TYPICAL_ORDER] â†’ {
    "Rice": "5-10 LB",
    "Dal": "2-4 LB",
    "Oil": "1 liter"
}
```

### 10. Reorder Timing (Simple Math, No ML)
```python
# Calculate reorder needs
Product â†’ [LAST_ORDERED] â†’ Date
       â†’ [TYPICAL_FREQUENCY] â†’ Days
       â†’ [CALCULATE] â†’ Days until reorder

# "Your rice order is due in 3 days based on your usual pattern"
```

### 11. Recipe-Based Grouping
```python
# User says: "I want to make biryani"
"Biryani" â†’ [REQUIRES] â†’ "Basmati Rice", "Ghee", "Saffron"
         â†’ [PAST_ORDERS] â†’ Show previous biryani shopping
         â†’ [QUANTITIES] â†’ Based on serving size
```

### 12. Substitution Memory
```python
# Remember substitutions
"Oat Milk" â†’ [SUBSTITUTED_FOR] â†’ "Dairy Milk"
          â†’ [WHEN] â†’ "3 months ago"
          â†’ [REASON] â†’ "Dietary change"
          â†’ [CONSISTENT] â†’ "Yes, every order since"
```

### 13. Price Sensitivity Patterns
```python
# Track price-based decisions
Product â†’ [PURCHASED_WHEN] â†’ "On sale"
       â†’ [SKIPPED_WHEN] â†’ "Regular price"
       â†’ [PATTERN] -> "Price sensitive"
```

### 14. Delivery Day Preferences
```python
User â†’ [PREFERS_DELIVERY] â†’ "Tuesday"
    â†’ [TIME_SLOT] â†’ "Morning"
    â†’ [FREQUENCY] â†’ "90% of orders"
```

### 15. Forgotten Items Detection
```python
# Common cart patterns
"Rice" + "Dal" â†’ [USUALLY_WITH] â†’ "Ghee"
              â†’ [FORGOTTEN_RATE] â†’ "30%"

# Prompt: "You usually also get ghee with rice and dal"
```

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Examples

### Basic Graphiti Setup
```python
class LeafLoafMemory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.graphiti = Graphiti()
    
    async def get_usual_order(self, user_id: str):
        """Get user's regular monthly items"""
        
        # Query for recurring patterns
        results = await self.graphiti.search(
            query=f"{user_id} regular monthly purchases",
            time_range=timedelta(days=90)
        )
        
        # Extract patterns (no ML needed)
        monthly_items = []
        for memory in results:
            if memory.frequency > 2:  # Ordered 3+ times
                monthly_items.append({
                    "product": memory.product,
                    "typical_quantity": memory.avg_quantity,
                    "last_ordered": memory.last_date,
                    "due_in_days": calculate_days_until_due(memory)
                })
        
        return monthly_items
    
    async def get_event_orders(self, user_id: str, event_type: str):
        """Get previous orders for similar events"""
        
        results = await self.graphiti.search(
            query=f"{user_id} {event_type} shopping",
            relationship_type="ORDERED_FOR_EVENT"
        )
        
        return {
            "previous_events": results,
            "common_items": extract_common_items(results),
            "typical_spend": calculate_average_spend(results)
        }
```

### Voice Conversation Using Graphiti
```python
# User: "I need my usual stuff"
usual_items = await memory.get_usual_order(user_id)

response = f"Your usual monthly order includes {len(usual_items)} items: "
for item in usual_items[:3]:  # Top 3
    response += f"{item['typical_quantity']} {item['product']}, "

response += "Should I add all of these to your cart?"
```

## ðŸ’¡ Why These Use Cases Are Powerful

1. **No ML Required** - All based on graph traversal and simple calculations
2. **Immediate Value** - Users see their patterns reflected instantly
3. **Natural Conversations** - "my usual", "like last time", "for my party"
4. **Builds Trust** - System remembers and understands context
5. **Reduces Friction** - Fewer clicks, faster ordering
6. **Competitive Advantage** - Most grocery apps don't have this memory

## ðŸš€ Quick Wins to Implement First

1. **"My usual order"** - Highest value, easiest to implement
2. **"Like last time"** - Simple last order lookup
3. **Event memory** - "What did I get for my last party?"
4. **Reorder reminders** - "You usually order rice every 2 weeks"
5. **Forgotten items** - "You usually get ghee with this"

These use cases will make LeafLoaf feel intelligent WITHOUT needing ML!
