# LeafLoaf Personalization - Continue TDD Implementation (Session 3)

## Current Status
- Completed 5/10 personalization features using TDD
- 49/49 tests passing (100% success rate)
- All documentation is current and complete
- Ready to implement feature #6: Dietary & Cultural Intelligence

## Project Overview
LeafLoaf is a production-grade grocery shopping system with advanced AI personalization, built using Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

## Key Files to Reference

### Project Context
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and current status
- `/docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` - Complete documentation index
- `/docs/PERSONALIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - TDD progress tracker

### API & Architecture
- `/docs/API_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete API reference
- `/docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture
- `/docs/AGENT_INTEGRATIONS.md` - How personalization integrates
- `/docs/API_RESPONSE_EXAMPLES.md` - Response examples

### Completed Features (Reference for patterns)
1. `/src/agents/response_compiler.py` - Enhanced with personalization
2. `/src/models/user_preferences.py` - User preference schema
3. `/src/agents/personalized_ranker.py` - Smart search ranking
4. `/src/agents/my_usual_analyzer.py` - My Usual functionality
5. `/src/agents/reorder_intelligence.py` - Reorder Intelligence

### Test Files (Follow these patterns)
- `/tests/unit/test_response_compiler_personalization.py` (9 tests)
- `/tests/unit/test_user_preferences.py` (10 tests)
- `/tests/unit/test_smart_search_ranking.py` (10 tests)
- `/tests/unit/test_my_usual_functionality.py` (10 tests)
- `/tests/unit/test_reorder_intelligence.py` (10 tests)

## Next Feature: Dietary & Cultural Intelligence

### Requirements
- Auto-detect dietary patterns from purchase history
- Cultural food understanding (e.g., "sambar ingredients")
- Allergen avoidance based on patterns
- Halal/Kosher/Vegan filtering
- Smart substitution suggestions

### Your Tasks
1. Write tests first (aim for 10 comprehensive tests)
2. Create `/src/agents/dietary_intelligence.py`
3. Implement features to pass all tests
4. Maintain <100ms performance target
5. Update documentation

### TDD Workflow Reminder
1. Write failing tests first (Red)
2. Implement minimal code to pass (Green)
3. Refactor and optimize (Refactor)
4. Document the results

## Key Architecture Points

### Personalization Components Location
- Search personalization: Integrated in `/src/agents/product_search.py`
- Order personalization: Integrated in `/src/agents/order.py`
- Response formatting: `/src/agents/response_compiler.py`

### Performance Targets
- Individual component: <100ms
- Total response time: <300ms
- Use async/await throughout
- Cache when appropriate

### Data Flow
1. User request → API → Supervisor
2. Supervisor loads preferences & routes
3. Agents process with personalization
4. Response compiler adds personalization section
5. Return unified response

## Useful Commands

# Run all personalization tests (should be 49 currently)
python3 run_all_personalization_tests.py

# Run specific test file
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_dietary_intelligence.py -v

# Check current implementation status
cat docs/PERSONALIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md | grep -A5 "Dietary"

## Integration Points

### User Preferences
The dietary preferences are already in the schema:
- `dietary_filters_enabled`
- `dietary_restrictions` (list)
- `allergen_alerts`

### Weaviate Product Schema
Products have dietary tags:
- `dietary_tags`: ["vegan", "gluten_free", "kosher", etc.]
- `allergens`: ["nuts", "dairy", "soy", etc.]
- `ingredients`: Full ingredient list

### Expected Test Coverage
- Dietary pattern detection from history
- Auto-filtering based on restrictions
- Cultural cuisine understanding
- Allergen avoidance
- Substitution suggestions
- Performance under 100ms
- Graceful handling of no dietary data
- Feature flag respect
- Confidence scoring
- Integration with search

## Success Criteria
- All tests passing
- Performance under 100ms
- Documentation updated
- Ready for feature #7

Remember: We're at 50% completion (5/10 features). Keep the momentum going!
```

## Key Patterns to Follow

### Test Pattern
```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_feature_name():
    # Arrange
    test_data = create_test_data()
    
    # Act
    result = await component.method(test_data)
    
    # Assert
    assert result meets expectations
    assert performance < 100ms
```

### Implementation Pattern
```python
class DietaryIntelligence:
    def __init__(self):
        self.logger = structlog.get_logger()
        
    async def analyze_dietary_patterns(self, purchase_history):
        # Implementation
        pass
```

### Integration Pattern
```python
# In product_search.py
if user_prefs.features.dietary_filters_enabled:
    results = await self.dietary_intelligence.filter_products(
        products=results,
        user_dietary_profile=profile
    )
```

## Notes for Next Developer

1. **TDD is Working**: We've proven it works with 49/49 tests passing
2. **Performance Matters**: Keep everything under 100ms
3. **Documentation is Key**: Update as you go
4. **Patterns Exist**: Follow the established patterns from features 1-5
5. **Test First**: Always write tests before implementation

## Session 2 Accomplishments

1. ✅ Implemented Reorder Intelligence (10/10 tests)
2. ✅ Fixed edge cases (microsecond precision, holiday handling)
3. ✅ Created 7 new documentation files
4. ✅ Updated all project documentation
5. ✅ Maintained 100% test success rate

Good luck with the next session!
