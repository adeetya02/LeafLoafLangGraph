# Production Test Summary

## Overall Status: ⚠️ Partially Working

### ✅ Working Features
1. **Health Check**: API is healthy, Weaviate connected
2. **Search Operations**: All search types working
   - Simple search: ✅ (660ms)
   - Category search: ✅ (762ms)
   - Brand search: ✅ (595ms)
   - Dietary search: ✅ (766ms)
   - Semantic search: ✅ (645ms)
3. **Session Memory**: Contextual searches working
4. **Connection Pooling**: Implemented (but auth issues locally)

### ❌ Issues Found
1. **Cart Operations**: Failed due to `time` import bug in response_compiler.py
   - Error: "name 'time' is not defined"
   - Fix: Added import at module level
   - Status: Deploying fix now

2. **Performance**: Average 521ms (target <300ms)
   - Search operations: 685ms average
   - Cart operations: ~120ms when working
   - Main bottleneck: Weaviate search (78% of time)

## Latency Breakdown

### Search Operations
```
Average: 685ms
├─ Supervisor: 61ms (9%)
├─ Product Search: 492ms (72%)
└─ Response Compiler: <1ms (<1%)
```

### Performance by Component
- **Supervisor**: 0-154ms (LLM intent analysis)
- **Product Search**: 450-635ms (Weaviate query)
- **Response Compiler**: <1ms (negligible)

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Fix deployed for cart operations
2. **Performance**: Implement Redis caching
3. **Optimization**: Connection pooling improvements

## Redis Caching Strategy (Proposed)
- Cache search results: 1hr TTL
- Cache alpha values: 24hr TTL
- Expected improvement: 60% cache hit rate → <300ms average
