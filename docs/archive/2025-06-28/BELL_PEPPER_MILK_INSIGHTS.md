## User Journey Summary
**User**: Sarah Jones (ID: sarah_jones_456)  
**Context**: Making stuffed bell peppers for dinner  
**Session**: pepper_milk_sim_1750916348

## Key Graphiti Discoveries

### 1. **Entity Extraction Evolution**
The system progressively discovered entities as the user searched:

- Step 1: "fresh bell peppers" → Extracted `Bell Peppers` entity
- Step 2: "red and yellow bell peppers" → Found specific products:
  - `Pepper Red Yellow 2 Pk` ($187.50)
  - `Pepper Red Bu` ($92.50)
- Step 4: "milk for cheese sauce" → Extracted `Milk` entity
- Step 5: "whole milk options" → Found specific milk products:
  - `Organic Whole Milk` ($17.50)
  - `Organic 2% Milk` ($16.20)

### 2. **Relationship Discovery**
Graphiti identified the key relationship:
```
Bell Peppers -USED_TOGETHER-> Milk
```
This was detected when the user mentioned needing milk "for the cheese sauce" after selecting bell peppers.

### 3. **Pattern Recognition**
- **Pattern**: `recipe_shopping`
- **Context**: "stuffed bell peppers recipe"
- **Products**: ["bell peppers", "milk"]

This pattern was detected when Graphiti noticed the user was searching for multiple ingredients in sequence with a cooking context.

### 4. **User Preferences Captured**
- `organic` - User selected "organic whole milk"
- `colorful_produce` - User specifically wanted "red and yellow" peppers
- `whole_dairy` - User requested "whole milk" for creamier sauce

### 5. **Performance Metrics**
- **Cart Operations**: 127-134ms ✅
- **Product Search**: 515-829ms
- **Graphiti Processing**: ~15ms (negligible overhead)

## Graphiti Value Demonstrated

### 1. **Recipe Intelligence**
Graphiti understood this was recipe-driven shopping, not random purchases. It captured:
- The recipe context (stuffed bell peppers)
- The relationship between ingredients (peppers + milk for cheese sauce)
- The purpose of each item

### 2. **Future Query Capabilities**
With this knowledge, Graphiti can now answer:
- "What did I buy for stuffed peppers last time?"
- "Show me ingredients that go with bell peppers"
- "What kind of milk did I use for cooking?"
- "Reorder my stuffed pepper ingredients"

### 3. **Recommendation Potential**
Based on the captured relationships, the system could suggest:
- Ground beef or rice (common stuffing ingredients)
- Cheese (for the sauce, goes with milk)
- Onions and garlic (common with bell peppers)
- Tomato sauce (often used in stuffed peppers)

### 4. **Shopping Pattern Understanding**
Graphiti identified this as "recipe_shopping" vs casual browsing, which means:
- User likely needs all ingredients at once
- Missing ingredients could be suggested
- Similar recipes could be recommended

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Persist to Graph Database**: Store these relationships in Spanner Graph
2. **Recipe Recognition**: Build a recipe detection system
3. **Complementary Suggestions**: Use graph traversal to find related items
4. **Temporal Patterns**: Track when users make similar purchases
5. **ML Recommendations**: Use graph embeddings for better suggestions

## Business Impact
- **Increased Basket Size**: Suggest missing recipe ingredients
- **Better User Experience**: Remember cooking preferences
- **Reduced Search Time**: "Reorder stuffed pepper ingredients"
- **Personalization**: Understand cooking vs snacking purchases
