# Dietary & Cultural Intelligence Implementation Summary

## Feature #6: Dietary & Cultural Intelligence ✅

### Accomplishments (2025-06-27)

#### 1. BDD Scenarios Created ✅
- Created comprehensive BDD scenarios in `docs/BDD_DIETARY_CULTURAL_SCENARIOS.md`
- 5 user stories with detailed Gherkin scenarios:
  1. Auto-detect vegan preferences
  2. Cultural cuisine understanding
  3. Allergen avoidance detection
  4. Smart dietary substitutions
  5. Multiple dietary restrictions

#### 2. TDD Implementation ✅
- Created `tests/unit/test_dietary_cultural_intelligence.py` with 16 comprehensive tests
- All 16/16 tests passing (100% success rate)
- Test categories:
  - Core functionality (10 tests)
  - Advanced pattern detection (2 tests)
  - Cultural intelligence (2 tests)
  - Performance and scaling (2 tests)

#### 3. Core Implementation ✅
- Created `src/agents/dietary_cultural_intelligence.py`
- Key features implemented:
  - Dietary pattern detection from purchase history
  - Cultural food pattern recognition
  - Smart product filtering based on restrictions
  - Allergen avoidance detection
  - Seasonal pattern awareness
  - Performance optimization with caching
  - User preference toggle support

### Technical Details

#### Data Structures
```python
@dataclass
class DietaryProfile:
    restrictions: List[str]  # ["vegan", "gluten-free"]
    preferences: List[str]   # ["organic", "local"]
    confidence_scores: Dict[str, float]
    insufficient_data: bool = False

@dataclass
class CulturalPattern:
    pattern_name: str  # "south_indian_cooking"
    common_ingredients: List[str]
    confidence: float
    suggests_vegetarian: bool = False
```

#### Key Methods
1. `analyze_dietary_patterns()` - Detects dietary restrictions from purchase history
2. `detect_cultural_patterns()` - Recognizes cultural cuisine patterns
3. `filter_products()` - Filters products based on dietary needs
4. `suggest_cultural_alternatives()` - Provides culturally appropriate substitutions
5. `detect_allergen_avoidance()` - Identifies potential allergen avoidance
6. `filter_with_explanation()` - Filters with transparent explanations

### Performance Metrics
- ✅ All operations under 100ms (tested with 1000 products)
- ✅ Caching reduces repeat calls to near-zero latency
- ✅ Handles 1000 concurrent users efficiently

### Privacy & Control
- ✅ Respects user feature toggles
- ✅ Works without purchase history (graceful degradation)
- ✅ Transparent filtering explanations
- ✅ User-level data only (no cross-user sharing)

### Test Results
```bash
# Run all tests
python3 -m pytest tests/unit/test_dietary_cultural_intelligence.py -v

# Results: 16 passed, 0 failed
# Average test execution time: 0.06s
```

### Next Steps (Remaining TODOs)
1. **Integration with Product Search Agent** - Apply dietary filters in search results
2. **Response Compiler Enhancement** - Add dietary explanations to responses
3. **Graphiti Memory Integration** - Store dietary entities for persistence
4. **Performance Optimizations** - Redis caching for production
5. **BDD End-to-End Tests** - Full scenario validation
6. **Staging Deployment** - Deploy and validate with real data

### Integration Points
The feature is ready for integration with:
- Product Search Agent (for filtering)
- Response Compiler (for explanations)
- Graphiti Memory (for persistence)
- User Preferences (already integrated)

### Success Criteria Met
- ✅ TDD: 16/16 tests passing
- ✅ Performance: <100ms latency
- ✅ Privacy: User-controlled feature flags
- ✅ Accuracy: High confidence pattern detection
- ✅ User Value: Smart filtering and suggestions
