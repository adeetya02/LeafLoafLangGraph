# GCP Deployment API Test Report
**Date**: 2025-06-24  
**Deployment URL**: https://leafloaf-32905605817.northamerica-northeast1.run.app

## Summary
All API endpoints are accessible and responding, but product search functionality is not returning results. The system appears to be attempting real Weaviate searches but failing to find products.

## Test Results

### 1. GET /health ✅ 
**Status**: Working
```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "timestamp": "2025-06-24T20:33:28.635137",
    "version": "1.0.0"
}
```
**Note**: Redis is not shown in health check (likely disabled)

### 2. GET /api/v1/agents ✅
**Status**: Working
```json
{
    "agents": [
        {
            "name": "supervisor",
            "type": "router",
            "description": "Analyzes queries and routes to appropriate agents"
        },
        {
            "name": "product_search",
            "type": "executor",
            "description": "Searches products with ability to refine results"
        },
        {
            "name": "order_agent",
            "type": "executor",
            "description": "Manages shopping cart and order operations with conversational memory"
        },
        {
            "name": "response_compiler",
            "type": "formatter",
            "description": "Compiles final response with execution transparency"
        }
    ],
    "flow": "supervisor → (product_search | order_agent) → response_compiler"
}
```

### 3. POST /api/v1/search ⚠️
**Status**: Partially Working (No Results Found)
**Test Queries**: "organic spinach", "bell peppers", "peppers", "tomatoes"

**Sample Response**:
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "query": "organic spinach",
    "products": [],
    "metadata": {
        "total_count": 0,
        "categories": [],
        "brands": [],
        "search_config": {}
    },
    "execution": {
        "total_time_ms": 357.96,
        "agent_timings": {
            "supervisor": 247.21,
            "product_search": 5.28,
            "response_compiler": 0.19
        },
        "reasoning_steps": [
            "Analysis (247ms) - Intent: product_search, Alpha: 0.50",
            "Search iteration 1: Performing general product search",
            "Only found 4 products - should search more broadly",
            "Search iteration 2: Too few results, broadening search to: spinach",
            "No products found - need to try different search strategy"
        ]
    },
    "message": "No products found. Try broadening your search.",
    "langsmith_trace_url": "https://smith.langchain.com/public/4139dd59-46f6-4493-a8d2-c34b8fffdb5b/r"
}
```

**Issues Identified**:
- Searches are being executed but returning 0 results
- System tries multiple search strategies but still finds nothing
- LangSmith tracing is working (good for debugging)
- Response times are reasonable (90-360ms)

### 4. POST /api/v1/order ⚠️
**Status**: Partially Working (No Products to Add)
**Test Query**: "add 2 bunches of organic spinach to my cart"

**Response**:
```json
{
    "success": false,
    "query": "add 2 bunches of organic spinach to my cart",
    "products": [],
    "execution": {
        "total_time_ms": 99.45,
        "agent_timings": {
            "supervisor": 77.60,
            "order_agent": 3.70,
            "response_compiler": 0.23
        },
        "reasoning_steps": [
            "Analysis (78ms) - Intent: add_to_order, Alpha: 0.50",
            "Order iteration 1: Need to get product information first",
            "Tool get_product_for_order needs another iteration",
            "Order iteration 2: Retrying to add items with more specific search"
        ]
    },
    "message": "No products found. Try broadening your search."
}
```

**Cart Display Test** (show my cart): Works correctly, showing empty cart

### 5. GET /api/v1/voice/health ✅
**Status**: Working
```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "checks": {
        "web_voice_handler": "healthy",
        "active_sessions": 0,
        "elevenlabs": "configured",
        "stt_fallback": "healthy"
    },
    "timestamp": "2025-06-24T20:33:29.465063"
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the configuration files:
- **TEST_MODE**: Set to "false" in .env.yaml
- **Weaviate**: Configured with valid URL and API key
- **Search Implementation**: Appears to be working but not finding data

### Possible Issues:
1. **Empty Weaviate Database**: The Weaviate instance might not have any products loaded
2. **Class Name Mismatch**: Using "Product" class but data might be in different class
3. **Weaviate Credits**: The CLAUDE.md mentions "Weaviate credits exhausted"
4. **Search Parameters**: The search might be too restrictive or using wrong fields

## Recommendations

1. **Check Weaviate Data**:
   - Verify products are loaded in Weaviate
   - Check if the "Product" class exists and has data
   - Consider running the data import script

2. **Enable TEST_MODE Temporarily**:
   - Set TEST_MODE=true to use mock data
   - This would confirm the API flow is working

3. **Debug Weaviate Connection**:
   - Check Weaviate logs
   - Test direct Weaviate queries
   - Verify the cluster is active

4. **Monitor Usage**:
   - Check Weaviate usage/credits
   - The free tier might have limitations

## Performance Notes
- **Latency**: Excellent (90-360ms total)
- **Agent Performance**: 
  - Supervisor: ~75-250ms
  - Product Search: ~3-5ms (suspiciously fast - might be failing quickly)
  - Response Compiler: <1ms
- **LLM Integration**: Working (intent analysis succeeds)

## Conclusion
The API infrastructure is working correctly, but the product search functionality needs attention. The most likely issue is an empty or misconfigured Weaviate database. Consider enabling TEST_MODE or loading product data into Weaviate to get the system fully operational.
