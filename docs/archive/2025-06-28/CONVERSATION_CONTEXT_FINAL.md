# LeafLoaf LangGraph - Final Conversation Context

## üéØ Project Status

LeafLoaf is a production grocery system with multi-agent architecture. We've designed a comprehensive natural language API with voice integration and are planning Graphiti integration for enhanced memory.

## üìÖ Session Summary (2025-06-26)

   - Purchase history included as core feature
   - Multi-turn conversation support
   - Saved in: `BASELINE_VOICE_API_SPEC.md`

2. **Conversational Flow Design**
   - 5-turn example with state management
   - Context propagation across turns
   - Natural language understanding
   - Saved in: `CONVERSATIONAL_API_FLOW.md`

3. **11Labs Voice Integration**
   - Complete webhook implementation
   - Voice-to-text-to-voice flow
   - Session mapping and user identification
   - Saved in: `11LABS_VOICE_INTEGRATION.md`

4. **Graphiti Integration Plan**
   - Knowledge graph for long-term memory
   - Temporal patterns and relationships
   - Complements LangGraph (not replaces)
   - ML to be added later
   - Saved in: `GRAPHITI_ML_INTEGRATION.md`

```

## üìù API Endpoints Defined

### 1. Natural Language Analysis
**POST** `/api/v1/analyze`
- Handles voice, text, images
- LLM extraction with confidence scores
- Returns product matches with purchase history
- Multi-turn conversation support

### 2. Direct Search (Typeahead) - Planned
**GET** `/api/v1/products/typeahead`
- <100ms response time
- No LLM processing
- For search bar autocomplete

## üîÑ Conversational Features

### Implemented in Design:
1. **State Management**: Each turn has state (awaiting_selection, clarification_needed)
2. **Context Accumulation**: Items build up before cart confirmation
3. **Purchase History**: "You usually order 2 bags"
4. **Natural Understanding**: "yeah" ‚Üí confirmation, "my usual" ‚Üí past pattern

### Voice-Specific Features:
1. Natural language variations handling
2. Interruption support
3. Voice menu building
4. SSML markup for better synthesis

## üöÄ Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Ship Baseline (Now)
- [x] Voice API with purchase history
- [x] Multi-turn conversations
- [x] 11Labs integration design
- [ ] Deploy and test

### Phase 2: Graphiti Integration (Next)
- [ ] Set up Neo4j and Graphiti
- [ ] Import purchase history to graph
- [ ] Add temporal relationships
- [ ] Enhanced memory queries
- [ ] NO ML YET - just graph features

### Phase 3: ML Enhancement (Later)
- [ ] Consumption prediction
- [ ] Pattern recognition
- [ ] Quantity optimization
- [ ] Churn detection

## üìä Key Technical Decisions

1. **Graphiti complements LangGraph**, doesn't replace it:
   - LangGraph: Orchestration and session state
   - Graphiti: Long-term memory and relationships

2. **ML comes after Graphiti**:
   - First: Get knowledge graph working
   - Then: Add ML predictions on top

3. **Purchase history is baseline**:
   - Not optional - core feature
   - Simple version ships first
   - Graphiti enhances it later

## üîë Important Code Snippets

### Purchase History (Baseline)
```python
product['purchase_history'] = {
    'previously_purchased': history.count > 0,
    'times_purchased': history.count,
    'last_purchased': history.last_date,
    'typical_quantity': history.avg_quantity,
    'is_regular_item': history.count >= 3
}
```

### 11Labs Webhook Handler
```python
# Map 11Labs to our format
api_request = {
    "input_type": "voice",
    "text": body["user_input"]["text"],
    "voice_metadata": {...},
    "user_id": user_id,
    "session_id": session_id
}
```

### Graphiti Integration (Planned)
```python
# Rich temporal queries
context = await graphiti.search(
    f"{user_id} rice shopping patterns"
)
# Returns relationships, timing, patterns
```

## üéØ Next Session Focus

1. **Implement Graphiti Integration** (without ML):
   - Set up Neo4j
   - Basic graph structure
   - Import existing purchase history
   - Simple temporal queries

2. **Test Voice Flow**:
   - Deploy baseline API
   - Test with 11Labs
   - Multi-turn conversations

3. **Refine Based on Testing**:
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling
   - Edge cases

## üí° Key Insights

1. **Start simple, enhance gradually**: Baseline ‚Üí Graphiti ‚Üí ML
2. **Purchase history is essential**: Not optional for grocery app
3. **Graphiti adds temporal intelligence**: "When" and "why" patterns
4. **ML comes last**: First get the foundation working

## üîó Quick Reference

- **Current latency**: 650-900ms (target <300ms)
- **Laxmi products**: 259 imported with pricing
- **Response Compiler**: Only 0.25ms overhead (not the bottleneck)
- **Main bottlenecks**: Supervisor (150ms) + Search (500ms)
