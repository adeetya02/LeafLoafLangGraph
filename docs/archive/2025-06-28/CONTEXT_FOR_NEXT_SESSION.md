# Context for Next Session - LeafLoaf LangGraph

## ðŸš€ Latest Accomplishments (2025-06-25)

### 1. Laxmi Catalog Processing âœ…
- **259 products** successfully processed from PDF
- **100% with prices** (wholesale: $10.50 - $171.00, avg: $45.23)
- **100% with UPCs** 
- All products imported to Weaviate with ethnic indicators
- Files in: `gs://leafloaf-supplier-data/laxmi/processed/`

### 2. System Architecture Designed âœ…
- **SYSTEM_DESIGN_NOTES.md**: Complete architecture with:
  - Pricing Agent (<50ms, no pre-calculated markups)
  - ML Recommendations (rule-based, no LLM)
  - Analytics Engine (comprehensive tracking)
  - Redis caching strategy
  - 300ms total latency budget

### 3. Processing Pipeline Established âœ…
- **SUPPLIER_PROCESSING_GUIDE.md**: Guidelines for all suppliers
- Parser: `parse_laxmi_final_fixed.py` (handles line-by-line format)
- Correct understanding: "8X908 GM" = 8 packets Ã— 908 grams

## ðŸ“‹ Key Design Decisions

1. **Search Terms**: Max 10-15, only non-obvious attributes
2. **No Markup in Data**: Pricing agent calculates at runtime
3. **Ethnic/Cuisine Fields**: Added to all products
4. **Pack Size Understanding**: Proper parsing of multi-level packs

## ðŸŽ¯ Ready for Next Phase

### Immediate Priorities:
1. **Design Pricing Agent** 
   - Redis cache schema
   - <50ms latency target
   - User segment based pricing

2. **ML Recommendations System**
   - Rule-based (no LLM)
   - Pre-compute at login
   - 5 products always

3. **Process More Suppliers**
   - Korean (romanization)
   - Chinese (pinyin)
   - Vistar (South Indian)

### System State:
- **Weaviate**: Has Laxmi products with cuisine='Indian'
- **Cloud Storage**: Organized supplier structure
- **Multi-Agent**: Working with cart operations fixed
- **Performance**: Currently ~450ms (target <300ms)

## ðŸ’¡ Important Context

### What Works:
- PDF processing pipeline for supplier catalogs
- Ethnic categorization for better search
- Wholesale pricing extraction
- Pack size parsing (multi-level)

### What Needs Work:
- Search term optimization (too many currently)
- Runtime pricing calculation
- ML recommendation engine
- Redis caching layer
- Analytics to BigQuery

## ðŸš€ Next Session Prompt

"Continue from where we left off with the LeafLoaf system. We just completed:
1. Processing 259 Laxmi products with prices (avg $45.23 wholesale)
2. Importing to Weaviate with cuisine='Indian' indicators
3. Designing the complete system architecture

Next priorities are:
1. Design the Pricing Agent for <50ms runtime calculations
2. Build the ML Recommendations system (rule-based, no LLM)
3. Set up Redis caching for search/prices/ML
4. Process more ethnic suppliers (Korean, Chinese)

Key context: No markups in data layer, max 10-15 search terms, 300ms total latency target."
