# Feature: Dietary & Cultural Intelligence

## PR Summary
This PR implements Feature #6: Dietary & Cultural Intelligence with full TDD/BDD approach.

## What's New
- 🥗 **Dietary Pattern Detection**: Automatically detects vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free preferences
- 🌍 **Cultural Food Understanding**: Recognizes South Indian, Italian, Mexican cuisine patterns
- 🚫 **Allergen Avoidance**: Detects potential allergen avoidance from purchase history
- 🔄 **Smart Substitutions**: Suggests culturally appropriate alternatives
- 🎯 **Auto-Filtering**: Products filtered based on detected dietary needs
- 💬 **Transparent Explanations**: Clear reasons for filtering decisions

## Technical Implementation
- **New Module**: `src/agents/dietary_cultural_intelligence.py`
- **Tests**: 16 comprehensive unit tests (all passing)
- **Performance**: All operations under 100ms
- **Privacy**: User-controlled feature flags
- **Caching**: Built-in performance optimization

## Testing
```bash
# Run dietary intelligence tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_dietary_cultural_intelligence.py -v

# Results: 16/16 tests passing ✅
```

## BDD Scenarios
- Created 5 comprehensive user stories with acceptance criteria
- Full documentation in `docs/BDD_DIETARY_CULTURAL_SCENARIOS.md`

## How to Test in Staging
1. Enable the feature: User preferences → dietary_filters = true
2. Test scenarios:
   - Search "milk" with vegan purchase history
   - Search "sambar ingredients" for cultural recognition
   - Search "gluten free pasta" for substitutions

## Files Changed
- `src/agents/dietary_cultural_intelligence.py` (new)
- `tests/unit/test_dietary_cultural_intelligence.py` (new)
- `docs/BDD_DIETARY_CULTURAL_SCENARIOS.md` (new)
- `docs/DIETARY_INTELLIGENCE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (new)
- `.github/workflows/deploy-to-gcp.yml` (updated with new tests)
- `cloudbuild-enhanced.yaml` (updated with new tests)
- `Dockerfile` (fixed .env.production.yaml issue)

## Next Steps
After staging validation:
1. Integrate with Product Search Agent
2. Add dietary explanations to Response Compiler
3. Enable Graphiti memory persistence
4. Deploy to production

## Performance Metrics
- Pattern detection: <50ms
- Product filtering: <30ms
- Cultural matching: <20ms
- Total added latency: <100ms ✅
