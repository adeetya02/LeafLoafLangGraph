# User Simulation Summary - Complete Flow with Graphiti

## Overview
The simulation successfully demonstrates a complete user journey through the LeafLoaf system, showing how all components work together including Graphiti knowledge graph integration.

## Key Components Working Together

### 1. **Supervisor Agent** (Ultra-fast routing)
- **Cache Hits**: 0.06-0.5ms when patterns match
- **Gemma Timeouts**: Falls back at 150ms to maintain speed
- **Smart Routing**: Correctly routes to product_search, order_agent based on intent
- Examples:
  - "I need organic milk" → product_search (0.06ms cache hit)
  - "Add 2 packets of Amul milk" → order_agent (0.24ms)
  - "What's in my cart?" → order_agent (0.39ms)

### 2. **Product Search Agent** (Weaviate integration)
- **Search Latency**: 210-295ms
- **Hybrid Search**: Using alpha=0.5 for balanced keyword/semantic
- **Results**: Finding relevant products (milk, bread)
- Examples:
  - "organic milk" → Found 10 products including Organic 2% Milk
  - "bread" → Found 7 products including Powerseed Bread
  - "Amul products" → No results (brand not in catalog)

### 3. **Order Agent** (Cart management)
- **Fast Operations**: 0.7-2.5ms for cart operations
- **Contextual**: Remembers previous searches via session memory
- **Actions**: Successfully adds items, shows cart
- Note: Some errors in cart operations need fixing

### 4. **Graphiti Integration** (Knowledge Graph)
The Graphiti component is extracting and tracking:

#### Entities Extracted
- **Products**: milk, bread, Organic 2% Milk, etc.
- **Brands**: Amul (from user query)
- **Categories**: dairy (inferred)

#### Relationships
- User → ORDERED → Product (when items added to cart)
- Amul → PRODUCES → milk (brand relationship)

#### Temporal Patterns
- Detected "frequent_search" for milk (searched 3+ times)
- Shopping pattern: "exploring" → "regular" (after 5+ interactions)

#### User Context Building
- **Preferences Identified**: 
  - "organic" (from "organic milk" query)
  - "brand:Amul" (from brand-specific query)
- **Session Products**: Tracking all products viewed
- **Graph Updates**: 15ms processing time (simulated)

### 5. **Response Compiler**
- **Latency**: 0.1-0.5ms
- **Minimal overhead** in final response generation

## User Journey Flow

1. **"I need organic milk"** (557ms total)
   - Supervisor: Routes to search (0.06ms)
   - Search: Finds 10 organic dairy products (232ms)
   - Graphiti: Extracts "milk" entity, notes organic preference
   
2. **"Show me Amul products"** (714ms total)
   - Supervisor: Routes to search (151ms - Gemma timeout)
   - Search: No Amul products found (219ms)
   - Graphiti: Notes "brand:Amul" preference
   
3. **"Add 2 packets of Amul milk"** (144ms total) ✅
   - Supervisor: Routes to order agent (0.24ms)
   - Order: Adds Organic 2% Milk as substitute (1.2ms)
   - Graphiti: Creates ORDERED relationship
   
4. **"I also need bread"** (798ms total)
   - Supervisor: Routes to search (152ms)
   - Search: Finds 7 bread products (245ms)
   - Graphiti: Detects milk is frequently searched
   
5. **"What's in my cart?"** (109ms total) ✅
   - Supervisor: Routes to order agent (0.5ms)
   - Order: Shows cart with 1 item (0.8ms)
   - Graphiti: Updates order context

## Performance Summary

### Latency Breakdown
- **Fast Operations** (<150ms): Cart operations ✅
- **Medium Operations** (150-500ms): Simple searches
- **Slow Operations** (>500ms): Complex searches, Gemma analysis

### Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Gemma Endpoint**: ~950ms (mitigated by 150ms timeout)
2. **Weaviate Search**: 210-295ms (main bottleneck)
3. **BigQuery Logging**: Schema errors (non-blocking)

## Graphiti Value Proposition

The Graphiti integration enables:

1. **Personalization**: Tracks user preferences (organic, Amul brand)
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies frequently searched items
3. **Context Awareness**: Builds shopping profile over time
4. **Relationships**: Maps user-product-brand connections
5. **Temporal Intelligence**: Could enable "What did I buy last week?" queries

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Order Agent**: Resolve the iteration error
2. **Optimize Weaviate**: Reduce search latency
3. **Deploy Gemma Properly**: GPU-enabled for <100ms
4. **Enhance Graphiti**: 
   - Connect to real graph database (Spanner Graph)
   - Implement temporal queries
   - Add recommendation engine
5. **Fix BigQuery Schema**: Update event_properties field type
