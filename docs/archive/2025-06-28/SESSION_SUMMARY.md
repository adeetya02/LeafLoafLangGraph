# Session Summary - LeafLoaf Development

## ✅ Accomplished Today

### 1. Fixed Authentication Issues
- Updated Weaviate API key in `.env` file
- Updated HuggingFace API key for vectorization
- Verified connection works locally and in production

### 2. Fixed Cart Operations Bug
- Fixed missing `time` import in `response_compiler.py`
- Cart operations now 100% functional:
  - Add to cart ✅
  - Update quantities ✅
  - Remove items ✅
  - View cart ✅
  - Clear cart ✅

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- Created user simulation test suite (`test_user_simulation.py`)
- Created comprehensive test reporter (`test_comprehensive_report.py`)
- Test Results:
  - Overall: 78.6% passing (11/14 tests)
  - Search: 62% (5/8) - Some queries return no results
  - Cart: 100% (5/5) - All operations working
  - Memory: 100% (1/1) - Context maintained
  - Performance: 171ms average (✅ under 300ms target)

### 4. Connection Pooling
- Already implemented in `weaviate_client_optimized.py`
- Pool size: 5-10 connections
- Keep-alive enabled
- Connection reuse working

## 📊 Current System Status

### Working Features
1. **Search Operations**
   - Simple product search ✅
   - Category search ✅ 
   - Brand search ✅
   - Product with modifiers ✅
   - Hybrid search with alpha calculation ✅

2. **Cart Operations** (Fixed!)
   - Add items by name ✅
   - Contextual additions ✅
   - View cart ✅
   - Update quantities ✅
   - Remove items ✅
   - Clear cart ✅

3. **Session Memory**
   - Context maintained across queries ✅
   - Search refinement working ✅

### Known Issues
1. **Limited Product Catalog**
   - "gluten free bread" returns 0 results
   - Typos not handled by search
   - Some semantic searches fail

2. **Performance**
   - Average: 171ms (good)
   - But production shows 500-800ms
   - Main bottleneck: Weaviate search

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (After deployment)
1. Verify cart operations work in production
2. Test end-to-end order workflow

### Performance Optimization
1. **Redis Caching** (discussed strategy)
   - Cache search results (1hr TTL)
   - Cache alpha values (24hr TTL)
   - Expected: 60% cache hit → <300ms

### Feature Implementation
1. **Lazy Loading**
   - Return 10 results initially
   - Load more on demand
   - Pagination support

2. **BigQuery Analytics**
   - Stream events for ML
   - Track user behavior
   - Build recommendation engine

3. **Import More Suppliers**
   - Expand product catalog
   - Better search coverage

## 🔧 Technical Decisions Made

1. **Always test locally first** before deploying
2. **Comprehensive test coverage** with real user scenarios
3. **Connection pooling** for better performance
4. **Fix bugs immediately** when found in testing

## 📝 Files Modified
- `.env` - Updated API keys
- `src/agents/response_compiler.py` - Fixed cart bug
- Created test suites for comprehensive coverage

## 🎯 Success Metrics
- Cart operations: 0% → 100% ✅
- Local tests passing: 42.9% → 78.6% ✅
- Performance: <300ms locally ✅

The system is now more stable with working cart operations. Once deployed, all core features should be functional!
