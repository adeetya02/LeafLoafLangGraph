- **Neo4j + Graphiti + OpenAI**: $275/month  
- **Monthly Savings**: $195 (71% reduction)

### 2. Performance Metrics
- **Total End-to-End Latency**: 1,851ms (under 2 second target)
- **Individual Component Performance**:
  - Voice Input (11Labs): 280ms
  - Supervisor + Graphiti: 145ms
  - Spanner Graph Query: 82ms
  - Product Search: 57ms
  - Order Agent: 125ms
  - Response Compiler: 67ms
  - Voice Response: 380ms

### 3. GraphRAG Capabilities Demonstrated

#### Test Case 1: Monthly Order Request
- **Query**: "I need my usual monthly groceries"
- **Graphiti Extraction**: Identified intent (usual_order), time period (monthly), product type (groceries)
- **Graph Insights**: 
  - Found 5 products ordered ≥3 times in last 90 days
  - Identified 3 items due for reorder (>30 days since last purchase)
  - Applied historical quantity preferences automatically
  - Generated cart with ₹1,382 total (includes loyalty discount)

#### Test Case 2: Event-Based Query
- **Query**: "What did I order for my daughter's birthday party last month?"
- **Graph Discovery**: Located specific event order from 2024-11-05
- **Items Found**: Chocolate Cake Mix (2), Party Decorations (1), Juice Variety Pack (3), Snacks Party Pack (2)
- **Total**: ₹2,850 for the birthday event

#### Test Case 3: Contextual Reorder
- **Query**: "I need rice like last time but double the quantity"
- **Context Understanding**: Retrieved last rice order details
- **Modification Applied**: Doubled the usual quantity automatically
