# Next Session Prompt for LeafLoaf Real-Time Personalization

## Context
You are continuing work on LeafLoaf after a failed demo. The generic flow wasn't appreciated by stakeholders, especially after talking up the AI/personalization capabilities. We need a production-grade personalization system in 2 days (not 4 weeks).

## Current Status
- **Previous Work**: Created REALTIME_PERSONALIZATION_PLAN.md with complete implementation plan
- **Critical Issue**: Weaviate search taking 699ms (too slow for voice/real-time)
- **Architecture Decided**: Real-time personalization with <10ms response, BigQuery for ML pipeline
- **Tech Stack**: React + Tailwind (NOT HTML), Cloud SQL for sessions/carts, Spanner for graph
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline ready (feature â†’ staging â†’ production)
- ðŸš€ Ready for Feature #6: Dietary & Cultural Intelligence

## ðŸ¥— Feature #6: Dietary & Cultural Intelligence

### Step 1: BDD Scenarios (Start Here!)

```gherkin
Feature: Dietary & Cultural Intelligence
  As a shopper with dietary needs
  I want LeafLoaf to understand my restrictions
  So that I see only suitable products

  Background:
    Given the dietary intelligence feature is enabled
    And the system has access to purchase history

  Scenario: Auto-detect vegan dietary preference
    Given user "sarah_vegan" has this 3-month purchase history:
      | Product | Category | Count |
      | Oat Milk | Dairy Alternatives | 12 |
      | Almond Yogurt | Dairy Alternatives | 8 |
      | Tofu | Plant Protein | 15 |
      | Tempeh | Plant Protein | 6 |
      | Quinoa | Grains | 10 |
    When sarah_vegan searches for "protein"
    Then the system should detect vegan dietary preference
    And confidence should be > 0.9
    And only plant-based proteins should appear
    And response should include "Showing vegan options"

  Scenario: Cultural cuisine understanding
    Given user "priya_indian" frequently buys:
      | Product | Category | Cultural Tag |
      | Toor Dal | Legumes | Indian |
      | Tamarind | Condiments | Indian |
      | Curry Leaves | Herbs | Indian |
      | Basmati Rice | Rice | Indian |
    When priya_indian searches for "sambar ingredients"
    Then the system should understand Indian cuisine context
    And suggest: dal, tamarind, sambar powder, vegetables
    And rank Indian grocery items higher

  Scenario: Allergen avoidance detection
    Given user "alex_allergic" has never purchased:
      | Allergen | Products Avoided |
      | Nuts | Almonds, Cashews, Peanut Butter |
      | Shellfish | Shrimp, Crab, Lobster |
    When alex_allergic searches for "snacks"
    Then products containing nuts should be filtered out
    And warning should appear for potential allergens
    And confidence in nut allergy should be > 0.8

  Scenario: Smart substitution suggestions
    Given user "emma_lactose" avoids dairy products
    When emma_lactose searches for "milk"
    Then dairy milk should rank lower
    And plant-based alternatives should rank higher
    And system should suggest "Try oat or almond milk instead"

  Scenario: Multiple dietary restrictions
    Given user "david_complex" has:
      | Restriction | Evidence |
      | Gluten-free | No wheat products in 6 months |
      | Vegetarian | No meat products in 1 year |
      | Low-sodium | Consistently buys low-sodium items |
    When david_complex searches for "dinner ideas"
    Then all results should be gluten-free AND vegetarian
    And low-sodium options should rank higher
    And system confidence should reflect all restrictions
```

### Step 2: TDD Tests to Write

Create `/tests/unit/test_dietary_intelligence.py`:

```python
# Test Categories:
1. test_vegan_preference_detection()
2. test_allergen_pattern_recognition()
3. test_cultural_cuisine_understanding()
4. test_halal_kosher_filtering()
5. test_dietary_confidence_calculation()
6. test_substitution_suggestions()
7. test_multiple_restrictions_handling()
8. test_preference_persistence()
9. test_performance_under_100ms()
10. test_gradual_learning_improvement()
```

### Step 3: Implementation Structure

Create `/src/agents/dietary_intelligence.py`:

```python
class DietaryIntelligence:
    """
    Detects and applies dietary preferences and restrictions
    Integrates with PersonalizedRanker for search filtering
    """
    
    async def analyze_dietary_patterns(self, purchase_history)
    async def detect_allergen_avoidance(self, purchase_history)
    async def understand_cultural_cuisine(self, query, user_profile)
    async def suggest_substitutions(self, product, restrictions)
    async def apply_dietary_filters(self, products, preferences)
    async def calculate_dietary_confidence(self, evidence)
```

### Step 4: Integration Points

1. **Supervisor Integration**
   - Extract dietary context from query
   - Pass to PersonalizedRanker

2. **PersonalizedRanker Enhancement**
   - Call DietaryIntelligence for filtering
   - Apply dietary scores to ranking

3. **Response Compiler Update**
   - Include dietary explanations
   - Show filtered count

4. **Graphiti Memory**
   - Store dietary preferences as entities
   - Track confidence over time

## ðŸš€ Deployment Strategy

### Feature Branch Testing
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/dietary-intelligence

# After implementation
git push origin feature/dietary-intelligence
# â†’ Automatic staging deployment
# â†’ URL: leafloaf-staging-feature-dietary-intelligence.run.app
```

### BDD Validation on Staging
```bash
# Run BDD tests against staging
behave tests/bdd/features/dietary_intelligence.feature \
  --define base_url=$STAGING_URL
```

### PR Process
1. All TDD tests passing (10/10)
2. BDD scenarios validated on staging
3. Performance under 100ms
4. Documentation updated
5. Code review approval
6. Merge to main â†’ Production

## ðŸ’¡ Implementation Tips

1. **Start with BDD** - Write the scenario first
2. **Break down to TDD** - Each step needs unit tests
3. **Use existing patterns** - Copy from completed features
4. **Test on staging** - Validate before production
5. **Document as you go** - Update progress tracker

## ðŸŽ¯ Session Goals

1. âœ… Write 5 BDD scenarios for Dietary Intelligence
2. âœ… Write 10 TDD unit tests
3. âœ… Implement DietaryIntelligence class
4. âœ… Integrate with existing agents
5. âœ… Deploy to staging and validate
6. âœ… Update documentation
7. âœ… Create PR for review

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress Tracking

After this session:
- Features completed: 6/10 (60%)
- Tests written: 59 total
- BDD scenarios: 5 new dietary scenarios
- Performance: Maintaining <300ms total

Remember: **BDD for the "what"**, **TDD for the "how"**!

Good luck! ðŸš€
