# Progress Context - 2025-06-25

## Completed Today

### 1. Fixed Contextual Cart Operations
- **Issue**: Order agent couldn't access search results from previous queries
- **Root Cause**: Each agent was creating its own SessionMemory instance
- **Solution**: Created singleton MemoryManager at `src/memory/memory_manager.py`
- **Changes**:
  - All agents now use `memory_manager.session_memory` instead of creating new instances
  - Product search stores results in session memory after each search
  - Order agent retrieves stored results when no results in current state

### 2. Updated Response Handling
- **Issue**: API was not returning order data for cart operations
- **Changes**:
  - Added `_compile_order_response()` method to ResponseCompilerAgent
  - Added `order` field to SearchResponse model in API
  - API now checks for order data and returns it appropriately

### 3. Key Files Modified
- `src/memory/memory_manager.py` - NEW: Singleton memory manager
- `src/agents/order_agent.py` - Uses shared memory, better logging
- `src/agents/product_search.py` - Uses shared memory
- `src/agents/supervisor.py` - Uses shared memory
- `src/agents/response_compiler.py` - Handles order responses
- `src/api/main.py` - Added order field to response

## Current Status

### Working
- Search returns all products (up to 15) in relevance order
- SKU support for unique product identification
- Contextual cart operations (memory sharing between agents)
- Sub-500ms performance (but not <300ms yet)
- BM25 fallback when vectorization credits exhausted

### Issues Remaining
1. **Session ID not passed through API properly**
   - Test shows session_id is None in order agent
   - Need to ensure session_id flows through entire graph

2. **Performance**: ~450-500ms (target <300ms)
   - Consider caching strategies
   - Optimize LLM calls
   - Implement Redis for faster memory access

3. **Duplicate reasoning steps in response**
   - Same analysis appears multiple times
   - Need to deduplicate or fix state management

## Test Results
- Intent recognition: 64% accuracy
- Response times: 316-814ms (avg 483ms)
- Cart operations working but need session_id fix

## Next Steps
1. Fix session_id propagation through graph
2. Implement Redis caching per user/UUID
3. Optimize for <300ms performance
4. Test complete flow with proper session management
