# LeafLoaf Store Owner Guide

## Welcome!

This guide explains how LeafLoaf's personalization features help your grocery business thrive. Written in plain English, no technical jargon.

## What is Personalization?

Think of it like having a friendly clerk who remembers every customer:
- "Good morning Mrs. Chen! Your usual Oatly milk?"
- "Mr. Johnson, the bread you like is on sale today"
- "I see you're making sambar - don't forget the curry leaves!"

LeafLoaf does this digitally, for ALL your customers, 24/7.

## How It Helps Your Business

### 1. Customers Find Things Faster
**Without Personalization**: Customer searches "milk" → sees 50 options → overwhelmed
**With Personalization**: Customer searches "milk" → sees their usual brand first → happy

**Your Benefit**: Less time searching = more time shopping = bigger baskets

### 2. Smart Reorder Reminders
**Example**: "Your Oatly milk (usually ordered every 5 days) - time to reorder?"
**Your Benefit**: Predictable sales, happy customers who never run out

### 3. Cultural Understanding
**Example**: Customer searches "dosa ingredients" → gets complete list including their preferred brands
**Your Benefit**: Serve diverse communities authentically

### 4. Works With Your Budget
- **Small Store** (< 100 daily users): Free, runs on basic server
- **Growing Store** (100-1000 users): Still free, same server
- **Large Store** (1000+ users): Add Redis for speed (~$50/month)
