## 1. Test Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 101 tests (100% passing)
- **Integration Tests**: Limited production flow tests
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Minimal
- **Performance Tests**: Basic latency checks only

### Missing Test Coverage

#### A. Graphiti Entity Extraction Edge Cases
```python
# Missing Test 1: Ambiguous entity extraction
def test_ambiguous_entity_extraction():
    """
    Test: "I need milk but not dairy milk"
    Expected: Should extract conflicting entities properly
    """

# Missing Test 2: Multi-language support
def test_multilingual_entity_extraction():
    """
    Test: "‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ù‡•á ‡§¶‡•Ç‡§ß ‡§ö‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§è" (Hindi for "I need milk")
    Expected: Should handle or gracefully fail
    """

# Missing Test 3: Typos and misspellings
def test_entity_extraction_with_typos():
    """
    Test: "I need orgnic mlk"
    Expected: Should still extract "organic" and "milk"
    """
```

#### B. Spanner Graph Consistency Tests
```python
# Missing Test 4: Concurrent graph updates
async def test_concurrent_spanner_updates():
    """
    Scenario: 10 concurrent requests updating same user node
    Expected: All updates should be atomic, no data loss
    """

# Missing Test 5: Graph cycle detection
async def test_circular_relationship_prevention():
    """
    Scenario: A prefers B, B prefers C, C prefers A
    Expected: System should handle or prevent cycles
    """

# Missing Test 6: Orphaned nodes cleanup
async def test_orphaned_entity_cleanup():
    """
    Scenario: Entities with no relationships after 30 days
    Expected: Should be marked for cleanup or archived
    """
```

#### C. BigQuery Event Processing Tests
```python
# Missing Test 7: Event ordering guarantees
async def test_bigquery_event_ordering():
    """
    Scenario: Rapid fire events from same session
    Expected: Events maintain correct temporal order
    """

# Missing Test 8: Duplicate event handling
async def test_duplicate_event_prevention():
    """
    Scenario: Network retry causes duplicate API calls
    Expected: Only one event should be recorded
    """

# Missing Test 9: Schema evolution
async def test_bigquery_schema_evolution():
    """
    Scenario: Add new field to event schema
    Expected: Old events still queryable, new events have field
    """
```

## 2. Performance & Scalability Tests

### Missing Performance Tests
```python
# Test 10: Pattern extraction at scale
async def test_pattern_extraction_performance():
    """
    Setup: 1M users with 100 interactions each
    Measure: Materialized view refresh time

```

## 3. Security & Privacy Tests

### Critical Missing Tests

    """

# Test 15: Session hijacking prevention
async def test_session_security():
    """
    Scenario: Attempt to use another user's session_id
    Expected: Should be rejected or create new session
    """
```

## 4. Business Logic Tests

### Missing Business Rule Tests
```python
# Test 16: Price consistency
async def test_price_consistency_across_sessions():
    """
    Scenario: Same product searched in different sessions
    Expected: Price should be consistent or explained
    """

# Test 17: Inventory availability
async def test_out_of_stock_handling():
    """
    Scenario: Add 100 items to cart when only 10 available
    Expected: Graceful handling with clear message
    """

# Test 18: Promotional rules
async def test_promotion_stacking_limits():
    """

## 6. Test Data Generation Strategy

```python
class TestDataGenerator:
    """Generate realistic test data for comprehensive testing"""
    
    @staticmethod
    def generate_user_journey(user_type: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Generate realistic user interaction sequence"""
        journeys = {
            "new_user": [
                {"query": "organic vegetables", "action": "search"},
                {"query": "add 2 organic tomatoes", "action": "add_to_cart"},
                {"query": "checkout", "action": "order"}
            ],
            "regular_user": [
                {"query": "my usual milk", "action": "search"},
                {"query": "add to cart", "action": "add_to_cart"},
                {"query": "anything else I need?", "action": "reorder_check"}
            ],
            "price_sensitive": [
                {"query": "cheapest rice", "action": "search"},
                {"query": "any deals on lentils?", "action": "search"},
                {"query": "total under 100", "action": "budget_check"}
            ]
        }
        return journeys.get(user_type, journeys["new_user"])
    
    @staticmethod
    def generate_edge_cases() -> List[Dict]:
        """Generate edge case scenarios"""
        return [
            {"query": "", "expected": "handle_empty"},
            {"query": "a" * 1000, "expected": "handle_long_query"},
            {"query": "üòÄüõíü•õ", "expected": "handle_emoji"},
            {"query": "'; DROP TABLE users; --", "expected": "handle_sql_injection"},
            {"query": None, "expected": "handle_null"}
        ]
```

## 7. Continuous Testing Strategy

### Automated Test Runs
1. **Pre-commit**: Unit tests (< 30 seconds)
2. **PR Merge**: Integration tests (< 5 minutes)
3. **Nightly**: Full edge case suite (< 30 minutes)
4. **Weekly**: Performance regression tests (< 2 hours)

### Production Monitoring Tests
```python
# Synthetic monitoring
async def synthetic_user_journey():
    """Run every 5 minutes in production"""
    # 1. Search for milk
    # 2. Add to cart
    # 3. Check personalization working
    # 4. Clean up test data
    
# Canary testing
async def canary_deployment_test():
    """Run on new deployments"""
    # 1. Test 1% traffic
    # 2. Monitor error rates
    # 3. Check latency impact
    # 4. Auto-rollback if issues
```

## 8. Test Documentation Template

```python
def test_example():
    """
    Test Name: Descriptive name of what's being tested
    
    Scenario: Detailed description of the test scenario
    
    Given: Initial state/preconditions
    When: Action taken
    Then: Expected outcome

    """
    pass
```

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement high-priority security tests
2. **This Week**: Set up automated test pipeline
3. **This Month**: Achieve 90% edge case coverage
4. **Quarterly**: Full performance regression suite
