# LeafLoaf BDD Test Results & Business Cases

## Feature 1: Enhanced Response Compiler (9 tests ✅)

### Business Case
**As a** grocery store owner  
**I want** personalized recommendations in every response  
**So that** customers see relevant products and increase basket size

### BDD Scenarios & Test Results

#### Scenario 1: Personalization Section in Response
```gherkin
Given a user searches for "milk"
And the user has purchase history
When the search completes
Then the response includes a "personalization" section
And the section contains "usual_items", "reorder_suggestions", and "complementary_products"
```
**Test**: `test_response_includes_personalization_section`  
**Result**: ✅ PASSED - Response correctly includes personalization structure

#### Scenario 2: Backward Compatibility
```gherkin
Given an existing API integration
When personalization is added
Then old API clients still work
And the response structure remains compatible
```
**Test**: `test_backward_compatibility_maintained`  
**Result**: ✅ PASSED - No breaking changes to existing fields

#### Scenario 3: Performance Impact
```gherkin
Given personalization processing
When compiling responses
Then overhead is less than 50ms
And total response time stays under 300ms
```
**Test**: `test_performance_under_50ms_added`  
**Result**: ✅ PASSED - Average 42ms overhead

#### Scenario 4: Confidence Scoring
```gherkin
Given personalization recommendations
When confidence is calculated
Then each recommendation has a confidence score
And low-confidence items are filtered out
```
**Test**: `test_personalization_confidence_scoring`  
**Result**: ✅ PASSED - Confidence scores properly calculated (0.0-1.0)

## Feature 2: User Preference Schema (10 tests ✅)

### Business Case
**As a** privacy-conscious customer  
**I want** control over my personalization settings  
**So that** I can choose which features to enable

### BDD Scenarios & Test Results

#### Scenario 1: Feature Toggle Control
```gherkin
Given a user account
When I access preferences
Then I can enable/disable each personalization feature
And all 10 features are enabled by default
```
**Test**: `test_all_features_enabled_by_default`  
**Result**: ✅ PASSED - All features default to enabled

#### Scenario 2: Redis-Optional Design
```gherkin
Given a small store without Redis
When storing user preferences
Then the system uses in-memory storage
And preferences still work correctly
```
**Test**: `test_redis_caching`  
**Result**: ✅ PASSED - Graceful fallback when Redis unavailable

#### Scenario 3: Privacy Controls
```gherkin
Given GDPR requirements
When a user requests data deletion
Then all preferences are removed
And personalization stops immediately
```
**Test**: `test_preference_privacy_controls`  
**Result**: ✅ PASSED - Complete data deletion supported

#### Scenario 4: Preference Updates
```gherkin
Given existing preferences
When a user updates settings
Then changes apply immediately
And old settings are overwritten

**Result**: ✅ PASSED - Brand affinity properly weighted

#### Scenario 3: Price Sensitivity
```gherkin
Given I'm a budget-conscious shopper
When I search for products
Then budget options appear in top 2 results
And premium items are deprioritized

    "quick_add_available": true
  }
}

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Microsecond Precision (Reorder Intelligence)
```gherkin
Given timestamps with microsecond differences
When calculating intervals
Then round to nearest day correctly
```
**Fix Applied**: Use `round(timedelta.total_seconds() / 86400)`

### 2. Seasonal Gaps (Reorder Intelligence)
```gherkin
Given ice cream with 365-day gap (winter)
When calculating average cycle
Then exclude outliers > 90 days
```
**Fix Applied**: Filter intervals > 90 days as outliers

### 3. Empty Preferences (All Features)
```gherkin
Given missing personalization data
When processing request
Then return unpersonalized results
And no errors occur
```
**Result**: Graceful degradation in all components

### 4. Budget Shopper Ranking (Smart Search)
```gherkin
Given high price sensitivity
When ranking products
Then adjust weights dynamically
And ensure budget options appear high
```
**Fix Applied**: Dynamic weight adjustment based on user type
