# Implementation Folder

This folder contains working implementations that are being developed and tested before integration into the main `src` folder.

## Structure

```
implementation/
├── deepgram/           # Deepgram streaming implementations
├── voice_analytics/    # Holistic voice analytics
├── agents/            # New agent implementations
└── features/          # New feature implementations
```

## Workflow

1. **Develop**: Create new implementation here
2. **Test**: Write and run tests
3. **Verify**: Ensure it works correctly
4. **Integrate**: Move to appropriate `src` location
5. **Clean**: Remove from implementation folder

## Current Implementations

### Deepgram Streaming
- `deepgram/test_deepgram_streaming.html` - Working linear16 audio streaming

### Voice Analytics (TODO)
- Holistic voice analytics implementation
- Emotion detection
- Conversation stage tracking

## Guidelines

- Keep implementations isolated
- Include README for complex implementations
- Test thoroughly before moving to src
- Document any dependencies or setup required
